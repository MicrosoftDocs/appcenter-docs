# Overview
[Azure Mobile App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-mobile/) is Microsoft’s solution for mobile application developers to leverage cloud backend services namely Identity, Table Storage and Push notifications in their app. From the last two years, Microsoft has been focused on building the next generation solution for the developer community and we wanted to share that **[Visual Studio App Center](https://appcenter.ms) is the next generation solution for mobile developers and will replace Azure Mobile Apps**. 

App Center is an integrated and one stop solution for native and cross platform mobile application developers that provides wide variety of services to help build a responsive and high-quality mobile application. 

## New Cloud Backend Services in App Center
