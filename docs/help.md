# Help and Feedback

The docs you'll find here should explain everything you need to know about Visual Studio App Center, sometimes the docs are not as clear as they should be, or you're trying to do something that isn't (yet) covered in the docs.

There's a dedicated support team ready to answer your product questions; look in the next section for instructions on how to connect with them.

App Center, and its product documentation, are both a work in progress, we're making regular updates to both. If you have a suggestion for how to make the product better or how to make the documentation better, we want to hear from you. Look in the **Providing feedback** section of this document for information on how to give us your feedback.

## Accessing App Center Support

Get support for App Center directly from within the App Center portal (not here in the docs). Any time you need help, just click the blue chat button in the lower-right corner of any App Center page and the dedicated App Center support team will respond. Use the **New Conversation** button shown in the following figure to start a conversation with our support team. You'll even find the App Center Program Management team hopping in to join the conversation as needed.

Use the **Search for answers...** input field to search help and troubleshooting documents that haven't made it into the formal docs yet.

For additional information, or to browse a list of articles available through support, see the [App Center Help Center](https://intercom.help/appcenter).

## Providing feedback

The comments feature of our documentation is intended to enable customers to suggest changes to the docs or ask clarifying questions about the docs. At the bottom of every documentation page (except the [App Center docs landing page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/)), you'll find the two options highlighted in the following figure:

![App Center docs feedback options](~/images/app-center-feedback-options.png)

1. The **Feedback** section of the page lists two buttons; use the **Product Feedback** button to connect with the App Center Support team (as described in the previous section), use the **Content Feedback** button to suggest changes to the docs.
2. In the bottom-right corner of the page you'll find a prompt asking you if the current page is helpful. Your vote here helps us understand how we're doing.

> [!Note]
> Option 1 is the preferred method to provide feedback; the feedback you provide here goes directly to the App Center product team and will get you the quickest response. Option 2 simply records your vote (and comments), but doesn't provide a way for us to respond to you.

## Contributing to the docs

The App Center docs are an open source project [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/appcenter-docs).

> [!Note]
> When you choose the option to provide content feedback described in the previous section, you're really just creating a Github issue in the App Center docs repository.

If you have some suggestions on how to make the docs better, and you have the time, you can make the changes yourself:

1. Fork the repository
2. Make the necessary changes to the documentation files (you'll do all your work in the repo's `docs` folder)
3. Submit a pull request (PR)
4. We'll review your changes and get back to you
