# Azure Subscriptions

While using the free tier, you do not need an Azure subscription, but once you decide to upgrade your plan you will be asked to connect your org/user account to an Azure Subscription.

With an Azure subscription you can manage all the billing and control the different costs of your team's usage.

 In this section we walk you through the following scenarios: 

- Connect an existing Azure subscription to my org/user settings.
- Create a new Azure Subscription and link it to my org/user settings.  


## Connecting to an existing Azure subscription


If you already have an Azure subscription that you have an "Owner" role on, you can connect it to your org/user settings. 

> [!WARNING]
> 
> Once you add an Azure subscription to an org, any org admin can use it to change billing settings within the same org. Org admins can make these changes to your Azure subscription without having to have an "Owner" role assigned to them.


1. First, you will have to choose the plan you would like to purchase for your org/user settings. If you haven't connected your org/user to an Azure subscription before, you will see a pop-up asking your to connect your Azure Subscription. Click **Connect**.

2. Enter your email to sign-in to Azure. You need a Work/School account or a Microsoft account. 

3. After signing-in, select your subscription from the list of subscriptions.

4. You will be re-directed to the billing page and you can continue your checkout process.
