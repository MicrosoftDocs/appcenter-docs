# App Center Product Roadmap
To more actively engage with our customers, we've moved our public roadmap to the [App Center GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/appcenter). Your comments on the Iteration Plan and Features create an open dialog between us and customers. This change also lets others see the feedback you share.

- Got a feature request and don’t know what to do with it? Add it as a feature to the repository. 
- Request changes to how a feature works? Let us know. 
- See someone else’s feature or comment that looks interesting? Give it a Thumbs Up or a +1 so we know you agree. Be sure to search the existing issues first before adding a new one to help us avoid duplicates.

## Product Technical Support
The GitHub repository isn't where you'll get [product support](https://docs.microsoft.com/appcenter/help). When you have issues, problems, or questions about how App Center works, you can contact support. In the App Center portal, in the upper-right hand corner, open **? (Help) > Contact support**. Our support team is there to answer your questions and help you solve your problems.
