# Product Roadmap

The list below presents the tentative roadmap for App Center for the next 3-6 months.

## General

* Manual bug tracker support - Integrate crash groups with your bug trackers directly to follow actionable work items.

## Distribution service

* Native Apps – View and install apps via a dedicated native app experience available for iOS and Android.
* Azure Active Directory (AAD) support – Reuse your existing Active Directory Groups to grant access in App Center.
* User metrics for distribution groups.
* Publishing MAM wrapped iOS apps to the Intune store.


## Crashes service

* ProGuard, NDK support.

## SDK

* Add formal support for Unity within App Center. This will allow developers to create Unity apps in the App Center portal and add the SDK to their app. SDK support will allow for diagnostics and analytics data as well as in-app updates with app distribution.
