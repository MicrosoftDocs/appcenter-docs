1. Log into App Center and select your app.
1. In the left menu, navigate to the **Diagnostics** section, then **Issues**.
1. If your application has not reported any crash yet, in the top-right corner, click **Upload symbols** and upload the file.
1. If your application already has reported crashes that need symbols, check the **Unsymbolicated** tab and there should be a version group with missing symbols, click on it to reveal the menu to upload the file.
1. After the symbols are indexed by App Center, crashes will be symbolicated for you.
