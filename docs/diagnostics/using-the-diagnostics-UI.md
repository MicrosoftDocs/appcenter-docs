# Using the Diagnostics UI

## General

App Centerâ€™s Diagnostics service is designed for you to easily monitor your apps' health and get the information you need to fix issues. 

1. Login to the App Center Portal
2. Select an application
3. In the navigation area on the left, select **Diagnostics**

For Android, Xamarin, Unity, , UWP, WPF and WinForms apps, App Center displays the crashes and errors in one view under the **Issues** tab. You can filter these issues by crashes or errors by clicking the respective tabs. 

For all apps, you can filter the diagnostics data by app version, build number, time range and status. Click on a group to find more information including a list of specific reports, devices and OSs affected.

3. In the upper right-hand corner, click the **annotate** button
4. Leave a text in the text box and your note will be automatically saved

### Track the status of your groups

Mark each of your groups as open, closed, or ignored. To mark the status of your groups:

1. Select a group or select multiple groups
2. Click on the **Mark as** button  
3. Select the state (open, closed, ignored)

Any new crash or error instance which is part of a closed or ignored group will not reopen or unignore the corresponding group.

Use the **Filter** option in the upper-right corner of the page to filter crashes/errors by open, closed, and ignored, focusing your view on the data that matters.
