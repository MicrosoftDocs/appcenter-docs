# Symbolication

## Overview

MacOS and iOS crash reports show the stack traces for all running threads of your app of the time a crash is occurred. The stack traces only contain memory addresses and don’t show class names, methods, file names and line numbers that are needed to read and understand the crashes.

To get these memory addresses translated you need to upload a dSYM package to App Center, which contains all information required to make this happen.  You can learn more about symbolication from Apple’s [official developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2151/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40008184-CH1-SYMBOLICATION).

### To find the `.dSYM` bundle

1. In Xcode, chose **Window > Organizer**
2. Select the **Archives** tab
3. Select your app in the left sidebar
4. Right-click on the latest archive and select **Show in Finder**
5. Right-click the `.xcarchive` file in Finder and select **Show Package Contents**
6. You should see a folder named `dSYMs` which contains your dSYM bundle

### To upload symbols

1. Create a ZIP file for the dSYM package on your Mac
2. Log into App Center and select your app
3. In the left menu, navigate to the **Diagnostics** section
4. Select **Symbols**
5. In the top right corner, click **Upload symbols** and upload the zip file
6. After the zip file is indexed by App Center, new incoming crashes will be symbolicated for you

## Bitcode

Bitcode was introduced by Apple to allow an app that is sent to the App Store to be compiled by Apple itself and apply the latest optimization. The consequence is that the *symbols* for the app in the store will be different from the ones generated by your own build system, and App Center will not be able to symbolicate your crash dumps.

App Center Crash Reporting does not support the symbolication of bitcode yet. We will be adding the support for bitcode soon, but in the meantime we advise that you **disable bitcode**. This doc will explain how to do that.

### How to disable bitcode for your app

1. Open your project settings by clicking on the top-level element in the Project Navigator
2. Go to the Build Settings page
3. Search for `bitcode`
4. In the result change the value from Yes to **No**
5. Rebuild your app

With these simple steps, you will have your App Center Crash behavior as usual.
