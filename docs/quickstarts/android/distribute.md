# Distribute Installable Sample App to Users
### Prerequisites
- Follow the [getting started tutorial](getting-started.md) to set up the sample app.
- Signed APK. Go to the [Android Developer Documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) to learn about creating a new keystore and manually signing an APK.


## Choose a build to distribute
There are **two ways you can distribute** the app.
If you have already completed the [Build tutorial](build.md) and built the sample app:
1. Navigate to the **Build** service in App Center and click on settings from your latest successful build.

2. Turn **Distribute builds** on and select a collaborator group. You can edit groups and add new groups in the **Distribute** service.

3. Click **Save** and allow the branch to build again.


Another way is to upload your own .apk file:
<em>Optional: From the Distribute service, click **New Group</em>* at the top of the page to add people to test the app or collaborate with you.*
1. Click **Distribute new release** at the top of the page.

2. Under **Upload your release**, navigate to the app-release.apk file that was generated when you signed the APK. Click Next.  

3. Leave Release notes blank. Click Next.

4. Under **Who are you distributing this release to?** select the distribution group. Click Next.

5. Click **Distribute**.


## Install the sample app
1. You, and all other specified testers, should receive an email with a link to download the sample app.

2. Open the link and follow the instructions to register your device with App Center, and the app will begin installing.
