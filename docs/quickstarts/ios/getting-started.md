# Getting Started - Sample Swift App and Tutorials

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up a sample Swift app with App Center for iOS. Note that both Objective-C and Swift are supported.

### Prerequisites
- [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
- [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12#)

## Login to GitHub and fork the repository
1. Login to your [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

2. Access the [sample app's GitHub repository](https://github.com/VSAppCenter/sampleapp-ios-swift).

3. Click **Fork** at the top right hand corner of the page, and clone the repository.

## Integrate CocoaPods
1. Open a terminal and go to the sample app's directory.

2. Run the command below to install CocoaPods:

  ```bash
  sudo gem install cocoapods
  ```

3. The included Podfile lists the dependencies in the source code. To install them, run the command below:

  ```bash
  pod install
  ```

4. Open the **.xcworkspace** and press **Run**. The app should build without error.


## Sign in to App Center

1. Open the [App Center portal](https://appcenter.ms).

2. Click **Connect with GitHub** and log in, or use another provider.

## Create a new app in App Center

1. Click **Add new app**.

2. Name the app **Sample iOS App**.

3. Choose **iOS** and **Objective-C / Swift**.

4. Click **Add new app** at the bottom.  
  
## Replace the App Secret

In order for the sample app to send information to App Center, the app secret must be changed in Xcode.

1. Navigate to the **Settings** page in App Center.

2. Copy the **App Secret** at the top.

3. Open the **.xcworkspace** from the sample app folder.

4. In **AppDelegate.swift**, edit the **didFinishLaunchingWithOptions** delegate method and paste your App Secret at the placeholder.

5. **Add, commit, and push changes to your forked repository.** This can be done from the terminal, or a tool of your choice.


## Codesign the project

_Codesigning is optional, but recommended._

Codesigning assures users that the app is from a trustworthy developer, and has not been altered by someone else. In App Center, it is needed to distribute the app to users and send push notifications. Learn more from the [Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/MaintainingProfiles/MaintainingProfiles.html).

When creating a new App ID for this sample app, be sure to check the **Push Notifications** service under the **App Services** section.

  1. Open **.xcworkspace** from the sample app's folder.

  2. Go to **General** within the .xcworkspace file.

  3. Under **Identity**, edit the **Bundle Identifier** to match the app ID.

  4. Import and select the provisioning profile under **Signing (Debug)** and **Signing (Release)**.

  5. **Add, commit, and push changes to your forked repository.** This can be done from the terminal, or a tool of your choice.

You're all set up to try out an App Center service. Not sure what to do next? Most people build their app next; check out the **[Build Tutorial](build.md)** for a short walkthrough.
