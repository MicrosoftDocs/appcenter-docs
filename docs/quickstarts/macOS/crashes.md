# Crashes - Sample Swift App and Tutorials
In this tutorial, you will learn to view crashes from a sample Swift app in App Center.

If you have not already, first follow the [getting started tutorial](getting-started.md) to set up the sample app.

## Get the symbols
In order to symbolicate crashes in macOS, App Center needs you to upload a **symbol file to App Center**. You can download symbols from a build in App Center, or skip this section and use your own.

If you already completed the [Build tutorial](build.md) and built the sample app:
1. Navigate to the **Build** service in the portal.

2. Select the **master** branch.

3. Click on the latest successful build.

4. Click **Download** > **Download symbols** at the top.

## Upload symbols
1. Navigate to the **Crashes** service and go to the **Symbols** page.

2. Click **Upload symbols** at the top of the page and upload the symbol file you just downloaded.

## Open the sample app
1. Run the sample app. If you're running it from **Xcode**, follow these additional steps to detach the debugger:

2. Right click on the app icon in the dock, **Options** then **Keep in Dock**.

3. Press the **Stop** icon to stop running the app.

4. Reopen the app by clicking on its icon in the dock.  

## Crashing the sample app
1. Navigate to the **Crashes** page. Click the **Send a sample crash** button to crash the app.

2. **Reopen the app.** This sends the crash report to the App Center backend.  

## View the crashes in App Center
1. Navigate to the **Crashes** service in App Center. It may take a couple minutes for the crash report to show up after reopening the app.
2. Click on the crash to view its details, such as its stack trace, affected devices, and more.
