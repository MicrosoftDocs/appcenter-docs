# App Center Test Core Concepts

It is helpful to familiarize yourself with the core concepts that comprise the App Center Test experience.


|       Concept        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Device Configuration |                                                                                                                                                                                    A combination of device model and operating system version. For example, an iPhone 7 running iOS 10 and an iPhone 7 running iOS 10.2 are 2 different configurations.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|     Device Tier      | Device configurations are organized by tiers. Tier 1 devices are those most popular in the market. This typically includes most flagship phones from the major manufacturers. Tier 1 devices are maintained at higher volume and tend to have shorter wait times than other tiers. As these configurations age, they will eventually become Tier 2. Tier 3 devices are typically edge devices - those not very common or popular in the market. Tier 3 devices are maintained in small volumes and have a high chance of longer wait times. |
|      Device Set      |                                                                                                                                                                            A collection of device configurations. Device sets are typically used to conveniently access devices commonly used for repeated tasks, such as devices for running basic smoke tests.                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  Device Concurrency  |                                     Device concurrency determines the number of devices an account can use simultaneously. This number is determined by the account's subscription level. Concurrency roughly translates to the speed at which test results will be returned. For example, an account with access to 10 concurrent devices will return results about twice as fast as an account with access to 5 concurrent devices. Device concurrency is also the metric on which pricing is based.                                      |
|       Test Run       |                                                                                                                                                                               An execution of your test suite against the provided app binary on the selected device set. Test runs can be kicked off using the App Center CLI tool.                                                                                                                                                                               |
|     Test Report      |                                                                                                                         The artifact generated by a test run. The test report includes the overall pass/fail status, a detailed breakdown of pass/fail status by manufacturer, operating system version, and form factor, and assets such as screenshots and device logs. Test reports are viewable in the web UI.                                                                                                                          |
|     Test Series      |                                                                                                                     Test Series are an arbitrary system for organizing your test runs. They can be thought of as labels which are used by the UI to group related test runs together. Common uses for test series include feature area (for example, "login tests") and development stage (for example, "smoke tests").                                                                                                                     |
