# Preparing Calabash Tests for Upload

For detailed instructions on preparing Calabash tests for upload, see the
[Xamarin documentation](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/calabash/).

Note you should not need to make any changes to your existing Calabash tests to run them in App Center.
You will only need the [App Center CLI](~/cli/index.md) and then command generated by
following the on-screen instructions in the **new test run** dialog.
