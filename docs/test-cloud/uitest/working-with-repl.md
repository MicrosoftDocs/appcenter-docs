# Working With the REPL

One of the important tools in creating UITests is the *REPL* (*read-eval-print-loop*). The REPL is a console-like environment in which the developer enters expressions or a commands. It will then evaluate those expressions, and display the results to the user.

The REPL is helpful when creating UITests &ndash; it allows us to explore the user interface and create the queries and statements so that the test may interact with the application.

## Starting the REPL

The REPL can only be started by running a test which calls the `IApp.Repl()` method:

```csharp
[TestFixture]
public class Tests
{
    AndroidApp app;

    [SetUp]
    public void BeforeEachTest()
    {
        app = ConfigureApp.Android.StartApp();
    }

    [Test]
    public void CreditCardNumber_TooShort_DisplayErrorMessage()
    {
        app.Repl();
    }
}
```

When the test is run and `.Repl()` is invoked, UITest will halt the test and start the REPL in a terminal window:


#### [Visual Studio](#tab/vswin/)

#### [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/vsmac/)

* * *
There are three ways to exit the REPL:

* Pressing **Ctrl-C**
* Typing **exit**
* Typing **quit**

UITest will resume executing the rest of the test when the REPL is closed. 

## Using the REPL

The REPL provides an instance of `IApp` that will allow interaction with the application. The REPL also provides two commands that are useful for creating UITests, the `tree` command and the `copy` command. 

A common workflow is to use the `tree` command or `IApp.Flash` to identify views on the screen and to obtain meta-data about those views. That information is used to to create `AppQueries` and spike out the steps that will make up a test. Then the `copy` command can be used to copy that work to the clipboard so that it may be pasted into the test.

## Discovering Views With the tree Command

The `tree` command will display a hierarchical list of the views that are visible on the screen:

## Discovering Views with IApp.Flash

Many of the UITest API's take an `AppQuery` object to locate views on the screen. The `IApp.Flash()` method can be very helpful in testing these queries in the REPL. `IApp.Flash()` will highlight the results of the query by making them flash, and return some details about the views in the results.

As an example, the following snippet shows how we can locate all of the `EditText` views that are visible on an Android activity: 

```bash
>>> app.Flash(c=>c.Class("EditText"))                               
Flashing query for Class("EditText") gave 1 results.
[
  {
    "Id": "creditCardNumberText",
    "Description": "android.widget.EditText{528165e4 VFED..CL .F...... 139,70-941,178 #7f050001 app:id/creditCardNumberText}",
    "Rect": {
      "Width": 802.0,
      "Height": 108.0,
      "X": 139.0,
      "Y": 274.0,
      "CenterX": 540.0,
      "CenterY": 328.0
    },
    "Label": null,
    "Text": "",
    "Class": "android.widget.EditText",
    "Enabled": true
  }
]
```

We can use the `Flash` method to help create `AppQuery`s to use in conjunction with the other APIs to work out a test. 

## Creating Steps in a Test

Let's see how we can use the REPL to quickly test out individual steps in a test without having to compile the application, deploy it to a device/simulator/emulator, and then run the application &ndash; a very time consuming process. 

As an example, we can use the results of the `tree` command above. If our test is required to enter text in the `EditText` with the ID of <span class="uiitem">creditCardNumberText</span>, it could use the `IApp.EnterText` method:

```bash
>>> app.EnterText(c=>c.Marked("creditCardNumberText"), "1234567890123456")
Using element matching Marked("creditCardNumberText").
Tapping coordinates [ 540, 328 ].
``` 

Likewise, if the test needs to simulate the user tapping on a button, it could use the `IApp.Tap` method:

```bash
>>> app.Tap(c=>c.Marked("validateButton"))
Using element matching Marked("validateButton").
Tapping coordinates [ 540, 533 ]. 
``` 

## Using the `copy` Command

The REPL will keep a history of the commands that you have entered into it during the session. The `copy` command paste those commands into the clipboard:

```text
>>> copy
Copying history to clipboard.
```

This allows you to test out and debug commands in the REPL, and then promptly update your test code.
