# Getting Started with Test Cloud

The requisite steps below must be completed before a project can be used with App Center Test Cloud.

## 1. Create an App Center account
Create an App Center account at [appcenter.ms](https://appcenter.ms) to gain access to Test Cloud.

## 2. Install the App Center CLI
Test runs are executed using the App Center CLI. If not already installed, follow [these instructions](~/cli/index.md) to install. After installation, run `appcenter login` to link an App Center account with the tool.

## 3. Create an app in App Center
All test assets and operations are within the context of an app. Create the app project to be tested.

## 4. Review the core concepts
Understanding the core concepts of the Test Cloud experience improve ease of use, navigation, and communications with support. It is recommended to become familiar with [these concepts](~/test-cloud/core-concepts.md) before running your first tests.

## 5. Prepare the project for upload
Each test framework has different requirements for uploading to Test Cloud. Follow the appropriate test framework branch from [this page](~/test-cloud/preparing-for-upload/index.md).
