# Overview
[Visual Studio App Center](https://appcenter.ms/) brings together multiple common services into a DevOps cloud solution. Developers use App Center to [Build](~/build/index.md), [Test](~/test-cloud/index.md), and [Distribute](~/distribution/index.md) applications. Once the app's deployed, developers monitor the status and usage of the app using the [Analytics](~/analytics/index.md) and [Diagnostics](~/diagnostics/index.md) services.

This section describes the basic concepts of App Center and ways to manage your account settings.

## Set up your App Center account
### Apps
To get started, [add an app to your App Center account](~/dashboard/creating-and-managing-apps.md) or accept an invite to someone else's app. You can have different permission levels for each app: **Developer**, **Viewer**, or **Manager**.

### Organizations
[Create an Organization](~/dashboard/creating-and-managing-organizations.md) to invite **Collaborators** and **Administrators** to work on your apps, and manage their permissions.

### Teams
[Create Teams](~/dashboard/creating-and-managing-teams.md) within your organization to better manage large organizations and permission settings.

## Manage your account preferences and settings
### Account Profile Photos
App Center uses [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/) to manage user profile photos. To get started, [create a Gravatar account](https://gravatar.com/) using the same email associated with your App Center account. Once your account has been created, follow the instructions on Gravatar's website to pick your new profile image. When you return to App Center, refresh the browser to see your new profile photo. If your new profile photo doesn't immediately appear, hard refresh your browser to replace the previously cached image.

### Email Notifications
[Manage your email preferences](~/dashboard/email-notifications/index.md) to sign up for automatic notifications for builds, distributions, and crashes.

### Bug Tracker Integration
[Integrate bug trackers](~/dashboard/bugtracker/index.md) like Jira, Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), Azure DevOps, and GitHub to stay informed when your app crashes.

### Webhooks
[Create and enable webhooks](~/dashboard/webhooks/index.md) to integrate with third-party applications you already use.

### Slack App
[Install the App Center Slack app](~/dashboard/slack/index.md) to easily trigger builds, monitor your app, and invite new testers directly from Slack.

## Manage App Center's theme
### Dark theme (Preview)
App Center can be used with a Dark theme. Under your account settings, go to the User Interface section to enable dark theme. Currently, dark theme is only available in Preview.
