# App Center Slack App

## Overview 

App Center Slack App empowers users to interact with App Center directly from Slack. 

Our aim is to enable users to quickly access App Center services and respond to critical app data in Slack, and distribute to Slack workspaces and messages. Users can easily trigger a build, view an app's analytics and crashes, and invite new testers to an app. This is done via [slash commands](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands) in Slack. 


## Getting Started

1. Navigate to [App Center's Slack App](https://slack.com/apps/A5ZK2MYJC), and install and authorize the app.

1. Navigate to your Slack workspace and select any direct message or channel.

1. In the **message** tab, run the Slash command `/appcenter`.

1. Authorize App Center's Slack App by following the instructions below:

	1. Go to https://appcenter.ms/settings/apitokens and create a new Full Access API token.
		- Here are details on how to [create a new Full Access API token](~/api-docs/index.md), in particular please see steps 4-5.
	1. Go back to Slack and run `/appcenter login <your token>` command.
	1. Welcome! You've successfully authorized your app.
	
1. You may run `/appcenter help` to see a complete list of App Center commands. Below is the list of commands supported by App Center Slack App:
