# App Center Email Notifications
## Overview

Many developers want to be automatically notified when key events happen in their apps, and not have to continually log in to a portal for information. Email and [webhooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/appcenter/dashboard/webhooks/) are important notification methods for that.

You can choose to have email notifications automatically sent for the following events:

- Build: 
  - Build success:
    - **Always**: when your app builds successfully
    - **Only if previously failed**: when your app has successfully built after one or more failed builds
    - **Never**: you will not receive notifications for build success

  - Build failure:
    - **Always**: when your app fails to build
    - **Only if previously successful**: when your app has failed to build after one or more successful builds
    - **Never**: you will not receive notifications for build failure

- Crashes: when a crash group is created
- Distribute: 
    - **Immediately**: when a new version is released
    - **Daily**: a summary of all your releases for that day will be sent at approximately 0:00 UTC
    - **Never**: you will not receive notifications when a new version is released
- Test: when a test run completes

App Center sends email notifications at two levels:  
  - **User level**: toggling email notifications here overrides all app level email notifications settings
  - **App level**: toggling email notifications here sets your preferences to receive emails at the app level. Currently, users are only able to toggle email notifications for themselves, not for all collaborators of the app.

App Center sends notifications using the alias `no-reply@mail.appcenter.ms`.

## Getting Started

### User level email notifications

1. Navigate to [https://appcenter.ms](https://appcenter.ms) and login with your account information.

2. On the bottom left corner, click your username and select **Account Settings**.

3. In the middle panel, select **Email notifications** from the menu list.

4. In the row panel titled **Receive notifications**, click the **toggle button** to enable or disable email notifications for all your apps.

The default email notification settings at the user level are toggled **On**.

### App level email notifications

App level email notifications send information for the specific app to the user.

1. Navigate to [https://appcenter.ms/apps](https://appcenter.ms/apps), and select the app you would like to configure email notifications for.

2. In the left panel, select **Settings** from the menu list.

3. In the row panel titled **Email notifications**, in the far right corner, click the **pencil icon** to edit your app level email notification settings.

4. In the row titled **Receive notifications**, click the **toggle button** to enable or disable email notifications for the app. Select the **dropdown** for Build status notifications and the **checkbox** for Crashes, Distribute and Test notifications to decide what events will trigger an email.

The default email notification settings at the app level are:
  - **On** for receiving email notifications
  - **Never** for Build
  - **Immediately** for Distribute
  - **unchecked** for Crashes
  - **checked** for Test events

You will receive automatic email notifications when your selected events happen. For example, here is what a Build success email notification looks like:

> [!NOTE]
> If your branch name contains other alphanumeric characters than `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-`, `+` and `/`, all email notifications will be successfully delivered. However, when you click on the **View Build** button in the email received, you might be directed to a non-existent page. This is due to the encodings for alphanumeric characters by some email services. We advise you to only use the supported characters in branch names. If this is a blocking issue for you, please contact us via support.
