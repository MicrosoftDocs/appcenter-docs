# Creating and managing teams

Any [collaborator](~/dashboard/creating-and-managing-apps.md) within an organization can create teams. Teams allow for better management of collaborators and app permissions.

## Creating teams

Any collaborator can create teams within an organization. Organizations can have multiple teams but each team belongs to only one organization. To create a team:

1. On the left side navigation, select your organization
2. Select **People**
3. Select **Teams** 
4. Click on the **Add New Team** button
5. Enter a team name
6. Click **Create Team** button

## Adding users to a team

The team creator or any organization admin can invite other collaborators to a team. A user must be invited (and have accepted the invitation) to the organization before they can join a team. 
 
## Removing users from a team

The team creator or any organization admin can remove users from a team.

## Adding the team to an app

The team creator, any [app manager](~/dashboard/creating-and-managing-apps.md), or any organization admin can add a team to an app. When a team is added to an app, all users of the team gain access to the app with the team's assigned role. 

There are two ways to add a team to an app: 

### In team setting 
1. On the left side navigation, select the team organization
2. Select **People**
3. Select **Teams** 
4. Select the team you wish to add to an app
5. In the top navigation, select **APPS** 
6. In the search box, type the app name you wish to add

### In app setting  
1. In the dashboard, select the app you wish to add a team to
2. In the left navigation, select **Settings** 
3. Click on **Collaborators** 
4. Type the team you wish to add to the app

## Removing the team from an app:
The team creator or any organization admin can remove a team from an app and the team member's permission to the app will be revoked.

## Changing Permissions

The team creator or any org admin can change the app permission of the team. Only admins can [change permissions of an individual user.](~/dashboard/creating-and-managing-apps.md) 
  
### Permission levels 
- **Manager** - invite members and access settings 
- **Developer** - manage services (e.g. create builds, run tests) 
- **Viewer** - view and download app data 

> [!NOTE]
> Users get the highest permission assigned (team level or app level). 

## Leaving a team 
Users can leave a team upon confirmation and will lose access to any apps associate with the team. The team creator cannot leave the team. The only option is to delete the team. 

## Deleting a team
The team creator or any admin can delete a team. All users in the team will have app permissions revoked.
