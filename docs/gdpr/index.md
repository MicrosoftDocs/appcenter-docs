# General Data Protection Regulation

Under GDPR entities either control data, process data, or do a mixture of both. Visual Studio App Center serves primarily as a data processor and its customers as data controllers. In some limited cases, App Center serves as a data controller with regard to its customers. Put simply, we collect customer data and data from your application end-users on your behalf. As such we provide you with two experiences: one where you are the data subject and one where you must accommodate your app end-users as data subjects.

In the sections listed under this one you will find instruction on how to manage your personal data and that of your customers.

> [!NOTE]
> This article provides steps for how to delete personal data from the device or service and can be used to support your obligations under the GDPR. If youâ€™re looking for general information about GDPR, see the [GDPR section of the Service Trust portal](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/GDPRGetStarted).
