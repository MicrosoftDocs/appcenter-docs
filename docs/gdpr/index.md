# General Data Protection Regulation

Under GDPR, entities either control data, process data, or do a mixture of both. Visual Studio App Center serves primarily as a data processor and its customers as data controllers. In some limited cases, App Center serves as a data controller to its customers. 

Put simply, we collect customer data and data from your application end users on your behalf. As such we provide you with two experiences: 
1. You act as the data subject, submitting a request on your own behalf. 
2. You act as the data controller, who must honor your app end user's rights as data subjects.

In subsequent sections, you'll find instructions on how to manage your personal data and that of your customers.

> [!NOTE]
> This article provides steps for how to delete personal data from the device or service and can be used to support your obligations under the GDPR. If you’re looking for general information about GDPR, see the [GDPR section of the Service Trust portal](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/GDPRGetStarted).
