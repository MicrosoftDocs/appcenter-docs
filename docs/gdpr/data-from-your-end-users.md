# Data From Your Users

This section and all its sub-documents will provide information and API pointers to help you, as an app developer using App Center, accommodate your customers as data subjects.

The first step will be to determine whether you collect personal information about your users. For that purpose, please consult [the section 'does it apply to me'](~/gdpr/does-it-apply-to-me.md). That section will detail the places where you might have sent such data to your app in App Center. You are invited to verify your code and processes to check whether this is the case or not.

Then if the answer to the above is yes, then you should consult the documentation for the services your are using. For each service, you will find information as to how to:

- Find the installation ID of a device for which you believe you have collected personal information in App Center, if you don't have it already
- Implement an opt-in/opt-out mechanism to allow you to take into account consent
- Export a specific device's data ("forget me")
- Delete data
