# Events Metrics

Events are actions that users take in your app. By tracking events in your app, you will learn more about your users' behavior and understand the interaction between your users and your apps. Attaching properties to your events will provide you with contextual information about the events.

Tracking events in your app allows you to answer questions like:

- What is the top N content viewed?
- What is the most liked content?
- What type of files do my users send?

To track custom events in your app, use our `trackEvent` API from the App Center Analytics SDK. More information on how to define custom events using our SDK can be found in [App Center SDK Documentation](~/sdk/index.md) for [Android](~/sdk/analytics/android.md), [iOS](~/sdk/analytics/ios.md), [React Native](~/sdk/analytics/react-native.md), [Xamarin](~/sdk/analytics/xamarin.md), [UWP](~/sdk/analytics/uwp.md) and [macOS](~/sdk/analytics/macos.md).

## General information

You can filter the events page by **time range** (the last 7, 30, 60, or 90 days), and for the selected **app version**. This allows you to drill down into your events data to the selected time period and/or app version.

## Events Page

The Events Page provides a table with an overview of the events happening in your app. This table can be sorted by count in both descending and ascending order. You can also look for an event in the table by its name. For each event, the following information is provided:

- **Count**: Number of times that an event has been triggered.
- **Trend**: Change of the count in absolute value and percentage change, compared to the previous selected time period.
- **Users**: Number of users that have triggered an event.
- **User change**: Change of the number of users in absolute value and percentage, compared to the previous selected time period.
- **Count per user**: Average number of times that an event is triggered per user.

## Detailed event view

By clicking on an event in the events table, you can see more detailed information on the event. This includes the metrics from the Events table per day for the selected time period. Also, you will see distribution of counts for your event properties.

Remove individual events from this page by clicking the settings option on top right of the page. Note that this action cannot be undone.

## Events Properties

Events Properties provide contextual information about the events. They allow to have a deeper understanding about the actions that the users take in your app.

Examples of events and properties are:

- *Event Name:* "File Upload", *Event properties:* ".PDF", ".txt", ".PNG".
- *Event Name:* "Question answered", *Event properties:* "Accept", "Decline", "Ignore".

Note that property values are optimized for values of type 'String'.

## Limits

- The maximum number of distinct custom events that can be tracked daily is 200. This count resets at 12 AM UTC. However, there is no limit on the maximum number of events instances sent per device.
- The maximum number of event properties per event is 20. When more than 20 properties are sent, the first 20 properties are processed, and the rest are automatically dropped.
- The portal will show up the ten property values with highest count.

## Breadcrumbs (Events before a crash)

Events can help you identify the root cause of app crashes. As part of the App Center Crashes service, you can see all the events that happened before a crash for a specific session.

In order to see the events before a crash, you must integrate the Analytics SDK into the app, and define one or more events.

Breadcrumbs are stored for just 28 days, while crashes can potentially be stored indefinitely. This means that if you are looking at a crash which is older than 28 days, you will not see the corresponding breadcrumbs.

## Handled Errors

To track handled errors in App Center, we recommend that you use the specific functionality for it. Check out more information on this topic in our [official documentation](~/diagnostics/index.md#errors).
