## Integrate the Analytics SDK to get started

To get started with Analytics, you must integrate the App Center SDK. By doing this, you will get out-of-the-box insights about your users.
To get started with our SDK, follow the platform-specific documentation at [Android](~/sdk/getting-started/android.md), [iOS](~/sdk/getting-started/ios.md), [React Native](~/sdk/getting-started/react-native.md), [Xamarin](~/sdk/getting-started/xamarin.md), [UWP](~/sdk/getting-started/uwp.md), [macOS](~/sdk/getting-started/macos.md), and [tvOS](~/sdk/getting-started/tvos.md).

## General information

Check out our [Frequently Asked Questions](~/analytics/faq.md) for general questions or concerns.

## Custom Events

Learn more about the interaction of your users with your app by tracking [Custom Events](~/analytics/event-metrics.md) in your app. To do this, follow our [SDK Documentation](~/sdk/index.md) for [Android](~/sdk/analytics/android.md), [iOS](~/sdk/analytics/ios.md), [React Native](~/sdk/analytics/react-native.md), [Xamarin](~/sdk/analytics/xamarin.md), [Windows](~/sdk/analytics/windows.md), [macOS](~/sdk/analytics/macos.md), and [tvOS](~/sdk/analytics/tvos.md).

## Export

[Continuously Export](~/analytics/export.md) all your Analytics data into Azure Blob Storage or Application Insights. This will allow you to keep your data as long as you need, as well as provide you with further insights into your data with powerful filtering, data visualizations, and query capabilities.
