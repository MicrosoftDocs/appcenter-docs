# Android Build

You can build Android apps written in [Java](~/build/android/first-build.md):

- [Configuring your first build](~/build/android/first-build.md)
- [Code Signing](~/build/android/code-signing.md)

We are constantly adding features and more capabilities. If you need further support in building your app, [contact us](https://intercom.help/appcenter/) and let us know more about your needs.
