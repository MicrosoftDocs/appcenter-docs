# Code signing for iOS

An app must be signed to run on a real device during the development process, through a beta program or in the App Store. Sign a build by uploading your provisioning profile (.mobileprovision) and certificate (.p12) when [configuring the build](first-build.md). Once you've saved a provisioning profile and the matching certificate to a build configuration of a branch, App Center will sign your app with the provided assets regardless of the settings of your project.

Learn more about where to [find the provisioning profiles and certificates](~/build/ios/uploading-signing-files.md) that are required for signing. When **Automatically manage signing** is enabled in the target of your project, it's possible to upload the developer provisioining profile generated by Xcode instead of one from the Apple Developer Portal.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Please make sure that the signing assets you upload are really the ones you intend to sign the app with. The bundle identifier and team ID in your app will be overwritten by the settings in the signing assets.

## Signing files

### Certificates (.p12)

- **iOS Development:** Used to enable certain app services during development and testing.
- **iOS Distribution:** For submission to the App Store, Ad Hoc or Enterprise distribution.

### Provisioning Profiles (.mobileprovision)

- **iOS App Development:** Install development apps on developer test devices.
- **Ad Hoc:** Install an app on a limited number of registered devices.
- **App Store:** Required for submitting your app to the App Store.
- **In House:** for In House app distribution (the profile is only available via the Apple Enterprise program).
