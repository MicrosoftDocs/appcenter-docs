# Node.js selection

## Major versions of Node.js
Any major Node.js version can be specified in the app's branch configuration.  
The following versions are available for use in App Center Build: 6.x, 8.x, 10.x, 12.x. (Latest stable versions can be found on [software page](~/build/software.md)).

## Using .nvmrc
If the app repository contains an `.nvmrc` file, the option **Use .nvmrc** will be available in the **Node.js version dropdown**. Select this option to use the node version from the `.nvmrc` file for the build.

- The `.nvmrc` file should be located in the same folder as the project's `package.json` file or in one of the parent folders
- The `.nvmrc` syntax can be found in [nvm docs](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#nvmrc)
