# React Native Build

You can build React Native apps for both Android and iOS. In order to get started, use the following links:

- [Configuring your first Android build](~/build/react-native/android/index.md)

- [Configuring your first iOS build](~/build/react-native/ios/index.md)

We are constantly adding features and more capabilities. If you need further support in building your app, [contact us](https://intercom.help/appcenter/) and let us know more about your needs.
