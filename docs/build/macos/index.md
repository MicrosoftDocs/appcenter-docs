# Mac Build

You can build Mac apps written in [Objective-C or Swift](first-build.md). The following links outline how to get started:

- [Configuring your first build](first-build.md)
- [Code Signing](code-signing.md)
- [Uploading signing files](uploading-signing-files.md)

While in preview, some of the features might not be available to all users. If you have interest in a specific feature, but you cannot find it in the UI, [contact us](https://intercom.help/appcenter/) and we can get you early access in case we're already testing it.
