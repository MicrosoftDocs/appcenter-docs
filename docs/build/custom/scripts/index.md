# Build scripts

You can add up to three custom build steps that run at pre-defined stages during build time: [post-clone](~/build/custom/scripts/index.md#post-clone), [pre-build](~/build/custom/scripts/index.md#pre-build), [post-build](~/build/custom/scripts/index.md#post-build). Place the scripts with the format specified below next to the project-level (**.xcodeproj**, **.csproj**, **.sln** or **package.json**) file or module-level (**build.gradle**) file that you've selected in the build configuration and we will run them as custom build steps. For iOS and Android apps, we support Bash scripts, for UWP apps we support PowerShell scripts. If one of your scripts is failing, the whole build will fail. This way we ensure it wonâ€™t fail at a later time and therefore saves you build time.

You can find a collection of build script examples on the [dedicated public GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/appcenter/tree/master/sample-build-scripts). We welcome contributions and suggestions - feel free to use the sample scripts, to modify them or to submit new pull requests with your most useful scripts, for the rest of the community to use them.

> [!NOTE]
> Once your build scripts have been detected for the first time or you made changes to the location of scripts or where you store CocoaPods for iOS projects, make sure to save the branch configuration to apply the changes! This will perform analysis to index your repository tree and save the new build definition.

## Post-clone

The post-clone script runs immediately after the repository was cloned but before we do anything else on our end.

To run scripts post-clone, add the following file next to the project file in your repository:

- **appcenter-post-clone.sh** (Bash for iOS & Android)

    ```shell
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    # Example: Clone a required repository
    git clone https://github.com/example/SomeProject

    # Example: Install App Center CLI
    npm install -g appcenter-cli
    ```

- **appcenter-post-clone.ps1** (PowerShell for UWP)

## Pre-build

The pre-build script runs before the actual build starts. For React Native apps, the script runs before generating source maps. For other platforms, it runs after we have installed dependencies from e.g. NuGet, CocoaPods or Carthage.

To run scripts pre-build, add the following file next to the project file in your repository:

- **appcenter-pre-build.sh** (Bash for iOS & Android)

    ```shell
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    # Example: Change bundle name of an iOS app for non-production
    if [ "$APPCENTER_BRANCH" != "master" ];
    then
        plutil -replace CFBundleName -string "\$(PRODUCT_NAME) Beta" $APPCENTER_SOURCE_DIRECTORY/MyApp/Info.plist
    fi
    ```

- **appcenter-pre-build.ps1** (PowerShell for UWP)

## Post-build

The post-build script runs after the build has finished and we have copied all the necessary artifacts to the output directory. Note that the post-build script will run even if the build fails.

To run scripts post-build, add the following file next to the project file in the repository:

- **appcenter-post-build.sh** (Bash for iOS & Android)

    ```shell
    if [ "$AGENT_JOBSTATUS" == "Succeeded" ]; then
        HOCKEYAPP_API_TOKEN={API_Token}
        HOCKEYAPP_APP_ID={APP_ID}

        # Example: Upload master branch app binary to HockeyApp using the API
        if [ "$APPCENTER_BRANCH" == "master" ];
         then
            curl \
            -F "status=2" \
            -F "ipa=@$APPCENTER_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/MyApps.ipa" \
            -H "X-HockeyAppToken: $HOCKEYAPP_API_TOKEN" \
            https://rink.hockeyapp.net/api/2/apps/$HOCKEYAPP_APP_ID/app_versions/upload
        else
            echo "Current branch is $APPCENTER_BRANCH"
        fi
    fi
    ```

- **appcenter-post-build.ps1** (PowerShell for UWP)

## App Center variables

We set the following environment variables, so you can access them from your build scripts.
