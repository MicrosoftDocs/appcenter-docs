# Testing on Real Devices
In this document, you'll learn how a successful build can be launched on a real device using App Center Test. Launching your app is very helpful when validating that your latest build is working.

## Configuring your branch
First, the branch needs to be setup before it's ready to run the launch test. You can read more about configuring your branch in the Configure a build respectively for [Android](~/build/android/first-build.md) and [iOS](~/build/ios/first-build.md).

Secondly, you need a subscription to App Center Test before you can enable launch test. If you're a first-time user of App Center Test, there's a free trial so you can see how it works. To activate your free trial, you can use the link below the _Run a launch test on a device_ option.

When you have an active subscription it's time to enable testing, all youâ€™ll need to do is to toggle _Run a launch test on a device_ option to on and click _Finish setup_ button. During the new build, there will be two parts, a build and a test part, so it's normal to have prolonged build time. The benefit is that you know whether your app starts on a physical device. What happens during the extended build is described more detailed in the [FAQ](faq.md#why-do-i-get-an-extended-build-time-when-run-launch-test-on-a-device-is-enabled)

Finding your launch test result can be done in two ways:

1. When the test is completed the app collaborators will receive an e-mail with test results
2. Go to _Test_ in the left-hand menu and follow along in the progress

## Unsupported configurations
When a build is running, the build configuration is composed of several parts: the build definitions you made in the code or in the IDE, and the settings you have chosen in App Center. The way configurations work is platform and language specific. Below are some known configurations where launch test is not supported.

* Some Android configurations can create several APK files. Which makes it unclear to the build service which binary to test. If you disable Generate one package(.apk) per selected ABI in your Android Build options, only one APK is created.
* Simulator builds for Xamarin apps don't output a binary and therefore can't be tested. This is the case for both iOS and Android
* Android apps without internet permissions cannot be tested using App Center Test. Internet permissions are needed for the test infrastructure to communicate with your app. In order to use launch test for your Android project, make sure to declare internet permissions in your app manifest
* iOS unsigned builds don't generate an .ipa file and they can't be tested on a real device.
