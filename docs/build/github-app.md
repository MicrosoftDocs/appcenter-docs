# Connecting Repositories Using the GitHub App

In this document, you'll learn how to install the App Center GitHub app and use this integration in your development workflow.

## Installing the App Center GitHub App

The App Center GitHub app is a [GitHub Marketplace](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-marketplace/) app and can be installed directly from GitHub.

To install the app, open a pull request in GitHub in a repository with a mobile project. After opening this pull request, a notification appears to set up continuous integration (CI) via a CI GitHub app. This notification only appears if you don't have any CI GitHub apps installed.

Follow the link in the notification to the mobile CI category of apps and choose the App Center app. Pick one of four plans, including a free tier, and install the app. The app can be installed in both your personal GitHub account and GitHub organizations.

## Onboarding Repositories using the GitHub App

After installing the GitHub App, sign in to App Center or create a new App Center account. Next, select the repository to set up and follow the wizard to create your app(s). The repositories shown are the ones App Center is authorized to see. Additional repositories can be shared by changing the [GitHub app configuration](https://github.com/settings/installations).

> [!NOTE]
> If the GitHub app was installed in a GitHub organization, an App Center organization is automatically created and that organization will be the owner of the new apps. Other members must be added to the App Center organization to see or edit the apps in App Center. You can read more about [App Center organizations](~/dashboard/creating-and-managing-apps.md).

Branches must be configured before a build can start. Read more about configuring your branch in the "Configure a build" articles respectively for [Android](~/build/android/first-build.md), [iOS](~/build/ios/first-build.md), and [Windows](~/build/windows/uwp/first-build.md). If youâ€™re building a pull request, specify the configuration for the target branch of that pull request.

## Reporting Build Status to GitHub

Opening a pull request on GitHub will start an App Center build, copying the build configuration of the target branch. App Center will skip the Launch Test and Distribution steps during this build. As the build runs and completes, App Center reports build status back to GitHub in the Checks tab of the pull request view. Navigate back to the build on App Center by clicking the **View more details on App Center** link. Pull requests from a forked repository won't build until merged or show under the Checks tab.

> [!NOTE]
> When opening a pull request on an unconfigured branch, the Checks tab will show that there is **Action Required**. Click the **Resolve** link to configure the branch.

## Connecting a New Repository

Add a new app by adding repository access to your GitHub app installation. [Configure your GitHub app installation](https://github.com/settings/installations) and select the new repository to grant access to and connect. After clicking **Save**, you'll be redirected to App Center to configure your new app.

> [!NOTE]
> The best way to take advantage of this is to choose access for **Only select repositories** and add each repository as you want to configure it. You may also need to add private [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) if your build depends on them. 

Additionally after you install the GitHub app, App Center sends a welcome email. Connect a new repository via the GitHub app by clicking the **Connect your repository** button in the email and repeat the process to create a new connection.

## Connecting Existing Apps

Existing App Center apps aren't able to report build status to GitHub, _unless_ they were onboarded with the steps above. Create a new app via the email link to take advantage of this feature.
