# Backing up Build data
Build data in App Center is kept for 30 days after creation. However, it can also be deleted before 30 days have passed in two ways:

- The configuration for the branch in App Center is deleted, which erases all data for that branch.
- The repository is disconnected via App Center, which erases all data for that repository.

> [!WARNING]
> If the repository is disconnected via the host rather than via App Center; build data is inaccessible in the UI. However, it can still be downloaded via the API or CLI by authenticated users who have access to the app in App Center. 

## Backup from the App Center Website
You can download data from your build by going to:
**appcenter.ms > [your account or organization] > [app name] > build > [branch name] > [build number] > download**
Example URL: https://appcenter.ms/orgs/ORG-NAME/apps/APP-NAME/build/branches/BRANCH-NAME/builds/BUILD_NUMBER

From there you can download build files, such as logs and app binaries. 

## Backup using the App Center API
General References:
- [App Center API Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/appcenter/api-docs/)
- [Swagger API methods for Build](https://openapi.appcenter.ms/#/build)

You can download logs & build artifacts using this API call: https://openapi.appcenter.ms/#/build/builds_getDownloadUri. The call works as long as the build data exists and your API credentials have permission to access that data.

## Backup using the App Center CLI
General References:
- [CLI Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/appcenter/cli/)
- [CLI Public Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/appcenter-cli)

You can use this command to back up your build data from the CLI:
> appcenter build download --id [BUILD_NUMBER] --app [ORG_NAME/APP_NAME] --type [logs, build, symbols]

Below is an example script that when given an organization & team you have access to, will download the logs for builds #1-10. 
```#!/bin/bash
# Customize this script to download build data you have permission to access in App Center. 

TEAM_APP='ORG_NAME/APP_NAME'

for i in {1..10} #downloads data from builds #1 - #10
do
   eval appcenter build download --id "$i" --app $TEAM_APP --type "logs"    
   #eval appcenter build download --id "$i" --app $TEAM_APP --type "build" #uncomment to download app packages
   #eval appcenter build download --id "$i" --app $TEAM_APP --type "symbols" #uncomment to download symbols
done
```

> [!TIP]
> If one of the commands fails, the script will output an error but continue executing. This means if you can use a general or approximate range for the build data. 

This script is also available on the [App Center Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/appcenter/blob/master/sample-build-scripts/general/build-results/download.sh)
