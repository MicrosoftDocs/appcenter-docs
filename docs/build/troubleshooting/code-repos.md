# Code Repository Troubleshooting

## <a name="not-listed"/>Repository isn't listed in the Connect to Repository step

* **Only Git repositories are supported**. Other repository types like Mercurial, TFVC, and so on, won't show up in the repository list.
* **Connecting to a user-owned repository must be done by the owner**. If you aren't the owner, you can still onboard the app by inviting the repository owner as a collaborator in App Center. Then, the owner can connect the repository as a source to the App Center build service.
* **Connecting to a repository owned by an organization on GitHub or team on Bitbucket requires admin access**. This access is required because App Center will register a webhook on the repository coming from the appcenter.ms domain.
* **For GitHub repositories, an organization member with owner privileges might need to approve the initial access request**. See GitHub's instructions on [approving third party apps for your organization](https://help.github.com/articles/approving-third-party-applications-for-your-organization/). It can take up to a few minutes until repositories from that organization will show up in App Center.

## <a name="on-premises"/>Can I use on-premises repositories?

App Center currently supports cloud hosted Git repositories on Azure DevOps (formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)), Bitbucket and GitHub, but doesn't support on-premises repositories.

## <a name="wrong-bitbucket"/>I've connected to the wrong Bitbucket account. How can I reconnect to the correct one?

Disconnect the connected Bitbucket account and [reconnect to the correct account](~/build/connect.md#bitbucket).

## <a name="reconnect-github"/>I've connected to the wrong GitHub account. How can I reconnect to the correct one?

Disconnect the connected GitHub account and [reconnect to the correct account](~/build/connect.md#github).

## <a name="wrong-VSTS"/>I've connected to the wrong Azure DevOps account. How can I reconnect to the correct one?

Disconnect the connected Azure DevOps (formerly VSTS) account and [reconnect to the correct account](~/build/connect.md#vsts).

## <a name="not-listed"/>When connecting an Azure DevOps repository, I see "No Projects Found"

It's possible when you first attempt to connect App Center to Azure DevOps (formerly VSTS) that it gets authorized under the wrong organization. Determine [which Azure DevOps accounts are associated with an organization](https://app.vsaex.visualstudio.com/me) and ensure yours is listed. When you attempt to complete the authentication flow in Azure DevOps, verify the message reads **App requests the following permissions from email@example.com (org)**. You'll need to [reconnect to the correct account](#wrong-VSTS) if you connected to the wrong account.

Another possibility is that OAuth is disabled under Security Policies settings. Follow [this guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/change-application-access-policies?view=azure-devops) to enable it.

## <a name="git-sub"/>Are Git submodules supported?

For repositories hosted on GitHub and Azure DevOps, Git submodules over HTTPS are supported using the same authentication as the parent repository. 
For repositories hosted on Bitbucket, only unauthenticated Git submodules are supported for now.

## <a name="bitbucket-git"/>I'm connected to Bitbucket and my builds fail with Git error

If your builds fail with an error similar to

```Text
"fatal: reference is not a tree:..
##[error]Git checkout failed with exit code: 128",
```

try the following steps:

* Go to the Webhooks section of the connected Bitbucket account and look for any disabled Webhooks from **appcenter.ms** & **mobile.azure.com**
* Re-enable the Webhooks
* Commit a change to the affected repository/branch and try a new build

Contact [App Center support]((https://intercom.help/appcenter/getting-started/getting-help-with-app-center) if the issue persists.

## <a name="tfvc"/>What can I do if I'm using Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC)?

App Center Build only supports Git repositories. For projects using a TFVC repository, you can [convert them to Git](https://docs.microsoft.com/vsts/git/import-from-tfvc), or you can use Visual Studio Team Services for continuous integration, and take advantage of the [Hosted macOS Preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/vsts/build-release/apps/mobile/xcode-ios?tabs=vsts) agents and build tasks for App Center Distribution and Test.

## <a name="code-source-secure"/>Is my source code secure?

App Center uses virtual machines to build your code. There's a clean virtual machine provisioned especially for your build, which gets discarded once the build finishes. The files uploaded for code signing and the password for the certificate are also stored securely on our servers.
