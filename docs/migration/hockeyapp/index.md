# HockeyApp Transition

App Center is the future home for your HockeyApp apps. We’ve spent the last year bringing HockeyApp’s Distribution, Crash Reporting, and Analytics services to App Center. But we didn’t stop there. We continued to build exciting next-generation features - such as auto-provisioning and public app store integrations - that make App Center even better than HockeyApp. At some point in the future we will be announcing the shutdown date of HockeyApp. At the time of the announcement, customers will have one year to complete their move to App Center. We are committed to making this process simple and seamless for you. 

## Your HockeyApp apps & data in App Center - Available Today

To help make this transition as easy as possible for you, we’ve created what we call our side-by-side experience. With the side-by-side experience, we’ve synchronized your HockeyApp apps with App Center. This allows you to explore and interact with App Center using your HockeyApp apps. Work in App Center, or in both App Center and HockeyApp as you normally would. Changes in one will automatically reflect in the other. To get started with the side-by-side experience, simply [sign-in to App Center](https://appcenter.ms/login?utm_medium=referral_link&utm_source=Hockey%20App) using your existing HockeyApp credentials. 

Learn more about the side-by-side experience [here](~/migration/hockeyapp/side-by-side.md). 

## Completing your migration to App Center

We are currently working on the migration experience that will allow you to start moving your apps completely from HockeyApp to App Center. Once available, you’ll be able to start officially migrating your apps with the click of a button. This will also be the moment when you can migrate your apps to the new App Center SDK. The App Center SDK is built to be faster and more modular than the HockeySDK. Ship the App Center SDK in a future release, and still receive data from the HockeyApp SDK in App Center from past releases. Follow our [transition](https://www.hockeyapp.net/appcenter/transition/) page for the latest updates.
