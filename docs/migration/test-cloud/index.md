# Upgrading all Xamarin Test Cloud subscribers to Visual Studio App Center<br/>
Microsoft will seamlessly upgrade active Xamarin Test Cloud subscriptions to [Visual Studio App Center](http://appcenter.ms). Visual Studio App Center offers the same devices, performance, and features as Xamarin Test Cloud, plus an upgraded API, unified CLI, and new features like saved device sets. It also integrates our automated test lab with our other App Center services, like cloud-based builds, app distribution, crash reporting, user analytics, and push notifications.<br/>
### Timeline<br/>
* March 31st, 2018 
	1. Teams / Orgs / Apps / previous test reports imported into App Center. 
	2. All test results uploaded via Xamarin Test Cloud CLIs will automatically route into App Center account.
	3. The [Xamarin Test Cloud](http://testcloud.xamarin.com) website will redirect to [Visual Studio App Center](http://appcenter.ms).
* Later this Spring
	1. Xamarin Test Cloud CLIs deprecated, everyone must use the [App Center CLI](https://github.com/Microsoft/appcenter-cli) to continue uploading.

### Next steps<br/>
Users must log into app center with the same email they used in Xamarin Test Cloud to benefit from the above import. If a user doesn't have an App Center account, one will be created and user will need to set a password.

* **If you do not have an App Center account**
	* [Create](http://appcenter.ms/) one today, use same email as you use in Xamarin Test Cloud.
	*  If you do not wish to try App Center before March 31st, you can simply wait until that day and we'll create the account and import your data for you.

* **If you already have an App Center account (email matches Xamarin Test Cloud)**
	* Relevant Teams / Orgs / Apps / previous test reports will import into App Center automatically.

### FAQ<br/>

**Q:** *How do I install the App Center CLI?*

In order to install appcenter-cli, open a terminal window and execute the following command:


```
npm install -g appcenter-cli
```

**Q:** Is the team that built App Center Test different than Xamarin Test Cloud? 

**A:** Visual Studio App Center Test is built and maintained by the same team as Xamarin Test Cloud, so we’re confident you’ll love what it has to offer. If you have any concerns at all, please contact your account manager or reach out to us on Intercom.

**Q:** *How is support handled in App Center?*

**A:** Support will now be handled in [Intercom](https://intercom.help/appcenter). If you have a question you can click the blue circle at the bottom right-hand side of your App Center dashboard to begin a conversation with one of agents.

**Q:** *What do I need to do during this upgrade?*

**A:** We'll handle the upgrade for you. On April 1st, you will simply log into App Center using your Xamarin Test Cloud account.

**Q:** *Can I upgrade to App Center before March 31st?*

**A:** You don’t have to wait until March 31st. App Center Test is fully functional and fully supported. If you have not already done so, please create a Visual Studio App Center account using the same email address as your Xamarin Test Cloud account. You can then familiarize yourself with all the features of Visual Studio App Center with the knowledge that we will migrate your Xamarin Test Cloud data into your new account on March 31st.

**Q:** What do I have to do if I have an App Center account already?

**A:** On March 31, 2018, as part of the upgrade, we will import your teams, orgs, users and test data into the Visual Studio App Center account with the same email address as your Xamarin Test Cloud account. If you do not have a Visual Studio App Center account at that time, we'll create one using the email address from your Xamarin Test Cloud account. If you currently have an App Center account, the email of the account must match your Xamarin Test Cloud email address exactly for this import to occur.

**Q:** *Will my service be interrupted?*

**A:** All Xamarin Test Cloud accounts will remain active until March 31, 2018. Your current tests will continue to work through that date. You will be able to create and run new tests as usual during that time and there will be no disruption of your current service. After March 31, 2018, the Xamarin Test Cloud portal will redirect to the Visual Studio App Center portal, and all future testing happens in App Center.


**Q:** *How do I purchase a test plan in App Center?*

**A:** If your plan is now expired you can purchase a test plan App Center through the "Billing" section . Note, paid services in App Center require an [Azure subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/general/azure-subscriptions/) for billing.

**Q:** *Who can I reach out to with additional questions?*

**A:** For more information about the upgrade, please don't hesitate to reach out on Intercom with any questions.
