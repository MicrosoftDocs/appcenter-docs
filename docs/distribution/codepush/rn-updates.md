# Releasing Updates

Once your app is configured and distributed to your users, and you have made some JS or asset changes, it's time to release them. The recommended way to release them is using the `release-react` command in the CodePush CLI, which will bundle your JavaScript files, asset files, and release the update to the CodePush server.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can start releasing updates, log into App Center by running the `appcenter login` command.

In its most basic form, this command only requires one parameter: your owner name + "/" + app name.

```shell
appcenter codepush release-react -a <ownerName>/<appName>

appcenter codepush release-react -a <ownerName>/MyApp-iOS
appcenter codepush release-react -a <ownerName>/MyApp-Android
```

> [!TIP]
> By using the App Center CLI `set-current` function you no longer must use the -a flag to specify which app a command is directed at.*

The `release-react` command enables such a simple workflow because it provides many sensible defaults (like generating a release bundle, assuming your app's entry file on iOS is either `index.ios.js` or `index.js`). However, all of these defaults can be customized to allow incremental flexibility as necessary, which makes it a good fit for most scenarios.

```shell
# Release a mandatory update with a changelog
appcenter codepush release-react -a <ownerName>/MyApp-iOS  -m --description "Modified the header color"

# Release an update for an app that uses a non-standard entry file name, and also capture
# the sourcemap file generated by react-native bundle
appcenter codepush release-react -a <ownerName>/MyApp-iOS --entry-file MyApp.js --sourcemap-output ../maps/MyApp.map

# Release a dev Android build to just 1/4 of your end users
appcenter codepush release-react -a <ownerName>/MyApp-Android  --rollout 25% --development true

# Release an update that targets users running any 1.1.* binary, as opposed to
# limiting the update to exact version name in the build.gradle file
appcenter codepush release-react -a <ownerName>/MyApp-Android  --target-binary-version "~1.1.0"
```

The CodePush client supports differential updates, so even though you're releasing your JS bundle and assets on every update, your end users will only download the files they need. The service handles this process automatically.

For more information about how the `release-react` command works, and the various parameters it exposes, see to the [CLI docs](./cli.md#releasing-updates-react-native). Additionally, if you'd prefer running the `react-native bundle` command yourself, and want a more flexible solution than `release-react`, see the [`release` command docs](./cli.md#releasing-updates-general) for more information.
