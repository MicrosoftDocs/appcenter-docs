# Publish an iOS package to TestFlight (External Testers)

1. From the Stores home page, select the external group to distribute to.
2. Select **Publish to Store** in the upper-right corner.
3. At the first step of the wizard, you need to upload your .ipa file. After the file has been successfully uploaded, you'll see details, like icon and version. Select **Next**.
4. Enter release notes. Only plain text is supported and release notes must be longer than 10 characters. Select **Next**.
5. Select **Publish**. The status for this release on the store details page will show as **Submitted**. Submitted means that the .ipa has been delivered to App Store Connect for evaluation.
6. Once App Center has completed the hand-over of the app to App Store Connect, the status of the app changes to **Published**, and the app is available to download through Apple's TestFlight service.
7. If a failure occurs with publishing by Apple, the status will change to **Failed** with the appropriate error message.
