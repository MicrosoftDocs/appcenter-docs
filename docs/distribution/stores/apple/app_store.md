1. From the Stores home page select the “Production” store created above.
2. Click on **Publish to Store** in the upper-right corner.
3. When the package has been uploaded, you should be able to see some details of the application. Click **Next**.
4. Click on **Publish**. The status for this release on the store details page will show as **Submitted**.
5. Once App Center has completed the hand-over of the app to iTunes, the status of the app will change to **Published**.
