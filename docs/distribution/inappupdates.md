# In-App Updates

Enable your testers to easily stay up to date with the latest releases. Integrate the App Center SDK (and the Distribution Module) for [iOS][ios-sdk], [Android][android-sdk], or [Xamarin][xamarin-sdk] to automatically enable in-app notification for new releases. Once completed, all [future releases][uploading] through App Center will trigger an in-app notification for each tester allowing a quick upgrade to the latest version.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> At this time, there are some limitations to In-App Updates:
> 1) Android devices will not be prompted for an update if there is no change in the version or build version.
> 2) For iOS public in-app updates, Apple has a default dialog that will have to be dismissed. Login is not required for the public flow.

## Public In-App Updates 

To enable public in-app updates, create a [public distribution group][public-dg] and distribute a release with the App Center SDK. Once your testers install the app, they will be alerted when new releases are publicly available. 

## FAQ

 1. Why are testers asked to authenticate for a public release?
  - We are actively working on making changes in the SDK to address this issue.

 2. Why are testers asked to authenticate repeatedly?
  - AppCenter SDK uses a device's default browser to store cookies. In the following cases, SDK will ask for reauthentication: 
    - Tester cleared cookies from device's default browser.
    - Tester disabled cookies for the device's default browser.
    - Tester closed the first authentication window after opening the app.
    - App Secret used to initialize the SDK is not the same as the one listed on the AppCenter web portal.   

 3. Why do testers not see an in-app update message when a new version of the app is released?
- Multiple scenarios can cause testers to not get in-app update notifications:
    - App Center SDK distribute feature is disabled. App Center SDK distribute feature must be enabled and initialized at app launch. If testers installed a version with the distribute feature disabled, they would need to install the latest version manually.
    - Release version of your app is incorrect for a new release 
      - For Android: increment version code.
      - For iOS: increment CFBundleShortVersionString and conform to semantic versioning standards

 4. Why do testers see "In-app Update disabled" message?  
- Multiple scenarios can make the App Center SDK to display this message:
  - The app was not installed from App Center. 
  - The version a tester installed was not released via App Center or the release was deleted on App Center.
  - App secret used in the SDK is incorrect. To get your app secret, go to your app's settings page, click on the triple vertical dots at the top right-hand corner, and copy app secret.
