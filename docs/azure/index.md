# Tables & Identity removed from App Center Preview

While we make architectural changes to provide a better experience, the [Tables and Identity services have been removed from the App Center Preview](https://intercom.help/mobile-center/build/changes-to-tables-and-identity).

You can still access the Tables and Identity services previously created in App Center by logging in to the [Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/). Follow this [illustrated walkthrough of the Azure portal steps](https://engineering.appcenter.ms/tables-identity-direct-access-a0a97f69b050) for accessing your existing services.
