> [!NOTE]
> App Center SDK supports the use of `XCframework`. If you want to integrate XCframeworks into your project, download the **AppCenter-SDK-Apple-XCFramework.zip** from the [releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/appcenter-sdk-apple/releases) and unzip it. Resulting folder contents aren't platform-specific, instead it contains XCframeworks for each module. They can be integrated the same way as usual frameworks, as described below.
