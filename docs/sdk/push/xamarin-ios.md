App Center Push enables you to send push notifications to users of your app from the App Center portal.

## Prerequisite - Enable Apple Push Notifications service (APNs) for your app

Please configure Apple Push Notifications service (APNs) for your app from your Apple developer account and the App Center portal before adding App Center Push to your app. App Center Push won't get any notifications if you don't setup push notifications.

### Enable push notifications on your application

Double-click the **Entitlements.plist** file in your Xamarin Solution Explorer. This will open the Entitlements.plist editor. Check the **Enable Push Notifications** checkbox from the **Push Notifications** section.

[!include[](ios-apns-setup.md)]

For more information, refer to the [Xamarin documentation](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/platform_features/introduction-to-ios10/user-notifications/enhanced-user-notifications/#Configuring-the-Remote-Notifications-Environment).

#### [Optional] Enable silent notifications

Silent notifications give you a way to wake up your app  so that it can refresh its data in the background (see [Xamarin documentation](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/application_fundamentals/backgrounding/ios_backgrounding_techniques/updating_an_application_in_the_background/#Remote_Notifications_iOS_7_and_Greater)). To enable silent notifications double-click the **Info.plist** file in your Xamarin Solution Explorer. This will open the Info.plist editor. Check **Background modes** then **Remote notifications** checkboxes from the **Background modes** section.

## Add App Center Push to your app

### 1. Add the App Center Push package

The App Center SDK is designed with a modular approach â€“ a developer only needs to integrate the modules of the services that they're interested in. It can be integrated using Visual Studio or Package Manager Console.

[!include[](add-nuget.md)]

### 2. Start App Center Push service

[!include[](start-push.md)]

>[!NOTE]
>If your Xamarin.iOS project is part of a [Xamarin.Forms](xamarin-forms.md) application, it is not necessary to add the call to `AppCenter.Start()` in the Xamarin.iOS portion of the project. The method call can instead be made from the PCL or shared project portion of your Xamarin.Forms application.

## Intercept push notifications

### Subscribe to the push event

[!include[](dotnet-push-event-intro.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If silent notifications are enabled **and** you push a notification with `content-available: 1`, then the event may be triggered twice for the same notification: when the notification is received in background and when it is tapped.

[!include[](dotnet-push-event-example.md)]

## Enable or disable Push at runtime

[!include[](enable-or-disable.md)]

## Disable automatic forwarding of application delegate's methods to App Center services

App Center uses swizzling to automatically forward your application delegate's methods to App Center services to improve SDK integration. There is a possibility of conflicts with other third party libraries or the application delegate itself. In this case, you might want to disable the App Center application delegate forwarding for all App Center services by following the steps below:

1. Open your **Info.plist file**.
2. Add `AppCenterAppDelegateForwarderEnabled` key and set the value to `0`. This will disable application delegate forwarding for all App Center services.
3. Implement two methods to register push notifications

    Implement the methods `RegisteredForRemoteNotifications` and `FailedToRegisterForRemoteNotifications` in your `AppDelegate` class as follows:

    ```csharp
    public override void RegisteredForRemoteNotifications(UIApplication application, NSData deviceToken)
    {
        Push.RegisteredForRemoteNotifications(deviceToken);
    }
    ```

    ```csharp
    public override void FailedToRegisterForRemoteNotifications(UIApplication application, NSError error)
    {
        Push.FailedToRegisterForRemoteNotifications(error);
    }
    ```

    >[!NOTE]
    >You may have already imlemented these methods while following Xamarin's documentation on enabling APNS. It is okay to replace the implementation from their example with the code provided above. You may also add the App Center lines of code above alongside existing code in your implementation of these methods.

4. Implement the callback to enable push event

    Implement `DidReceiveRemoteNotification` in your `AppDelegate` class as follows:

    ```csharp
    public override void DidReceiveRemoteNotification(UIApplication application, NSDictionary userInfo, System.Action<UIBackgroundFetchResult> completionHandler)
    {
        var result = Push.DidReceiveRemoteNotification(userInfo);
        if (result)
        {
            completionHandler?.Invoke(UIBackgroundFetchResult.NewData);
        }
        else
        {
            completionHandler?.Invoke(UIBackgroundFetchResult.NoData);
        }
    }
    ```

Now, the `Push.PushNotificationReceived` event will be invoked when your application receives a push notification. This event is also accessible from the PCL part of a Xamarin.Forms project.
