# How to upgrade App Center Push to a newer version

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note this feature is being retired. For more information, please see the [blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/appcenter/app-center-mbaas-retirement/). For more information, refer to the [Push Migration Guide](~/migration/push/index.md).

Updating the App Center SDK does not require any action by the developer except for the exceptions that are outlined below.

> [!NOTE]
> The App Center SDK features a modular architecture to enable developers to integrate only the features they need. It is not possible to mix different versions of App Center modules. Once you update App Center Push, you need to update all App Center SDK modules to the same version.

## Upgrading to App Center Push 1.10.0 or later from a version < 1.10.0

Version 1.10.0 (released in November 2018) fixes a bug in the `push:didReceivePushNotification` callback. If (and only if) the developer sets their own `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate`, the callback was not triggered once a notification was tapped or once it was received while the app was in the foreground. To fix this issue, App Center Push captures the `UNUserNotificationCenter`'s delegate and swizzles its methods to forward incoming notifications and notification-related actions to the App Center SDK.

If you want to disable the swizzling of `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` callbacks,  please refer to [the documentation to disable automatic method forwarding of UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate methods](~/sdk/push/react-native-ios.md#user-notification-center-delegate).

In case you did not implement your own `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate`, there is no action required.

If you are using App Center Push's default setup logic (i.e. you did NOT add the `AppCenterUserNotificationCenterDelegateForwarderEnabled` entry to your **Info.plist** or it is set to `1`) and are implementing your own `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` callbacks, please do the following:

1. Check if you are calling `MSPush`'s `didReceiveRemoteNotification:` method. If you are not, skip step 2; no action is required.
2. Remove any explicit calls to `MSPush`'s `didReceiveRemoteNotification:`. For example, you no longer need to call `didReceiveRemoteNotification:` inside your `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` callbacks as App Center will swizzle the `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` callbacks in addition to your custom implementation.
