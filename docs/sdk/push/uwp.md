App Center Push enables you to send push notifications to users of your app from the App Center portal and relies on [Windows Notification Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/controls-and-patterns/tiles-and-notifications-windows-push-notification-services--wns--overview) (WNS) to push notifications to the devices.

> [!NOTE]
> The device displays a toast only if the application is in background at the moment the Push is received.

## Prerequisite - Register your app for Windows Notification Services (WNS)

Before you can send notification using WNS, your app must be registered with the Windows Store. This will provide you with credentials for your app that App Center will use to authenticate with WNS. These credentials consist of a Package Security Identifier (SID) and an application secret key. To perform this registration, you need to associate your app with the Windows Store in Visual Studio.

[!INCLUDE [windows wns](includes/windows-wns.md)]

## Add App Center Push to your app

Please follow the [Get started](~/sdk/getting-started/uwp.md) section if you haven't set up and started the SDK in your application.

### 1. Add the App Center Push package

The App Center SDK is designed with a modular approach â€“ a developer only needs to integrate the modules of the services that they're interested in. It can be integrated using Visual Studio or Package Manager Console.

[!INCLUDE [add nuget](includes/add-nuget.md)]

Now that you've integrated App Center Push in your application, it's time to start the SDK and make use of App Center.

### 2. Start App Center Push

[!INCLUDE [start push](includes/start-push.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If your UWP project is part of a [Xamarin.Forms](xamarin-forms.md) application, it is not necessary to add the call to `AppCenter.Start()` in the UWP portion of the project. The method call can instead be made from the PCL or shared project portion of your Xamarin.Forms application in the `OnStart` callback.

## Intercept push notifications

App Center Push makes it possible to intercept push notifications but there is some setup required to enable this feature in UWP.

### Additional setup

Call `Push.CheckLaunchedFromNotification(e);` at the end of the `OnLaunched` method in your UWP application source file (not in the portable application file if you use Xamarin.Forms).

```csharp
protected override void OnLaunched(LaunchActivatedEventArgs e)
{
    // other code...

    // This should be the last instruction
    Push.CheckLaunchedFromNotification(e);
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> * If you use Xamarin.Forms, make sure the `AppCenter.start` call is made in the `OnStart` callback of the Xamarin.Forms application class.
> * If you don't use Xamarin.Forms, make sure the `AppCenter.start` call is made  in the application constructor or before `Push.CheckLaunchedFromNotification`.

### Subscribe to the push event

[!INCLUDE [dotnet push event intro](includes/dotnet-push-event-intro.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> No toast is shown when the push is received in foreground.
> 
> [!NOTE]
> If the push is received in background, the event is **NOT** triggered at receive time. The event is triggered when you click on the notification.
> 
> [!NOTE]
> UWP toasts do **NOT** expose **title** and **message** to the background notification click callback. **Title** and **message** are only available in **foreground** pushes.

[!INCLUDE [dotnet push event example](includes/dotnet-push-event-example.md)]

## Custom data in your notifications

You can send optional custom data as part of the push payload. The data will be sent in the key-value format. This custom data can be intercepted in the app through Push SDK callback.

There are few reserved keywords that can be set via custom data.

### Reserved keywords in Windows platform
- **audio**: Add this key when you want the to play a sound. this will modify the audio attribute for toast notifications.
- **image**: Add this key when you want to modify the image attribute for tile and toast notifications.

## Enable or disable App Center Push at runtime
