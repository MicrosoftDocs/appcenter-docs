You need to register the listener when your app starts. A convenient place to do that is at the outer level in the .js file for your root component:

```javascript
import Push from 'appcenter-push';
import { AppState, Alert } from 'react-native';

class MyApp extends Component {
}

Push.setListener({
  onPushNotificationReceived: function (pushNotification) {
    let message = pushNotification.message;
    let title = pushNotification.title;

    if (message === null) {
      // Android messages received in the background don't include a message. On Android, that fact can be used to
      // check if the message was received in the background or foreground. For iOS the message is always present.
      title = 'Android background';
      message = '<empty>';
    }

    // Custom name/value pairs set in the App Center web portal are in customProperties
    if (pushNotification.customProperties && Object.keys(pushNotification.customProperties).length > 0) {
      message += '\nCustom properties:\n' + JSON.stringify(pushNotification.customProperties);
    }

    if (AppState.currentState === 'active') {
      Alert.alert(title, message);
    }
    else {
      // Sometimes the push callback is received shortly before the app is fully active in the foreground.
      // In this case you'll want to save off the notification info and wait until the app is fully shown
      // in the foreground before displaying any UI. You could use AppState.addEventListener to be notified
      // when the app is fully in the foreground.
    }
  }
});
```
