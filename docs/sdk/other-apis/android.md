## Adjust the log level

You can control the amount of log messages by App Center that show up in LogCat. Use the `AppCenter.setLogLevel()` API to enable additional logging while debugging. The log levels correspond to the ones defined in `android.util.Log`. By default, it is set it to `ASSERT` for non-debuggable applications and `WARN` for debuggable applications. You can set the log level at any time you want.

To have as many log messages as possible, use `Log.Verbose`.

```java
AppCenter.setLogLevel(Log.VERBOSE);
```

## Identify installations

The App Center SDK creates a UUID for each device once the app is installed. This identifier remains the same for a device when the app is updated and a new one is generated only when the app is re-installed or the user manually deletes all app data. The following API is useful for debugging purposes.

```java
AppCenter.getInstallId();
```

[!include[](../android-see-async.md)]

## Disable all services at runtime

If you want to disable all App Center services at once, use the `setEnabled()` API. When disabled, the SDK will not forward any information to App Center.

```java
AppCenter.setEnabled(false);
```

To enable all services at once again, use the same API but pass `true` as a parameter.

```java
AppCenter.setEnabled(true);
```

[!include[](../android-see-async.md)]

## Check if App Center is enabled

You can also check if App Center is enabled or not.

```java
AppCenter.isEnabled();
```

[!include[](../android-see-async.md)]

## Check App Center SDK version at runtime

You can get the version of App Center SDK that you are currently using.

```java
AppCenter.getSdkVersion();
```

## Use custom properties

App Center allows you to define custom properties as key value pairs in your app. You may use custom properties for various purposes. For instance, you can use custom properties to segment your users, and then send push notifications to a specific [audience](~/push/audiences.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Only devices that have [Push](../push/android.md) successfully registered are matched in audiences.

You can set custom properties by calling the `setCustomProperties()` API. A valid key for custom property should match regular expression pattern `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$`. A custom property's value may be one of the following Java types: `String`, `Number`, `boolean` and `Date`. 

```java
CustomProperties properties = new CustomProperties();
properties.set("color", "blue").set("score", 10);
AppCenter.setCustomProperties(properties);
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you set the same custom property more than once, previous values will be overwritten by the last one.

You may remove any custom property by calling the `clear()` API. This will only remove the value of the property for a device. It will not remove the property name from App Center portal.

```java
CustomProperties properties = new CustomProperties();
properties.clear("score");
AppCenter.setCustomProperties(properties);
```
