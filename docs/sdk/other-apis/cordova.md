## Adjust the log level

You can control the amount of log messages that show up from App Center in the console. To do this, open the project's **config.xml** file; for each of your Apache Cordova project's target `platform` elements (only Android and iOS today), add a child `preference` element in the following format:

```xml
<preference name="LOG_LEVEL" value="2" />
```

Set the value to one of the constants, described well in the official [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/util/Log#constants_2). Same contants can be used for iOS.

To have as many log messages as possible, use **VERBOSE (2)** level.

## Identify installations

The App Center SDK creates a UUID for each device once the app is installed. This identifier remains the same for a device when the app is updated and a new one is generated only when the app is re-installed or the user manually deletes all app data. The following API is useful for debugging purposes.

```javascript
var success = function(installId) {
    console.log("Install ID: " + installId);
}

var error = function(error) {
    console.error(error);
}
AppCenter.getInstallId(success, error);
```

## Identify users

The App Center SDK supports setting a **user ID** that is used to augment crash reports. To use this capability:

1. Configure the App Center SDK as described in the [App Center SDK Getting started guide](~/sdk/getting-started/cordova.md).
2. Set a `userID` in the SDK using the following code:

```javascript
AppCenter.setUserId("your-user-id");
```
[!INCLUDE [user id](includes/user-id.md)]
