### Get information about the sending status for a crash log

At times, you would like to know the status of your app crash. A common use case is that you might want to show UI that tells the users that your app is submitting a crash report, or, in case your app is crashing very quickly after the launch, you want to adjust the behavior of the app to make sure the crash logs can be submitted. The `MSCrashesDelegate`-protocol defines three different callbacks that you can use in your app to be notified of what is going on:

#### The following callback will be invoked before the SDK sends a crash log

```objc
- (void)crashes:(MSCrashes *)crashes willSendErrorReport:(MSErrorReport *)errorReport {
  // Your code, e.g. to present a custom UI.
}
```
```swift
func crashes(_ crashes: MSCrashes!, willSend errorReport: MSErrorReport!) {
  // Your code, e.g. to present a custom UI.
}
```

#### The following callback will be invoked after the SDK sent a crash log successfully

```objc
- (void)crashes:(MSCrashes *)crashes didSucceedSendingErrorReport:(MSErrorReport *)errorReport {
  // Your code, e.g. to hide the custom UI.
}
```
```swift
func crashes(_ crashes: MSCrashes!, didSucceedSending errorReport: MSErrorReport!) {
  // Your code goes here.
}
```

#### The following callback will be invoked if the SDK failed to send a crash log

```objc
- (void)crashes:(MSCrashes *)crashes didFailSendingErrorReport:(MSErrorReport *)errorReport withError:(NSError *)error {
  // Your code goes here.
}
```
```swift
func crashes(_ crashes: MSCrashes!, didSucceedSending errorReport: MSErrorReport!) {
  // Your code goes here.
}
```

### Add attachments to a crash report

You can add **one binary** and **one text** attachment to a crash report. The SDK will send it along with the crash so that you can see it in App Center portal. The following callback will be invoked if you want to add attachments to a crash report:

```objc
- (NSArray<MSErrorAttachmentLog *> *)attachmentsWithCrashes:(MSCrashes *)crashes
                                             forErrorReport:(MSErrorReport *)errorReport {
  MSErrorAttachmentLog *attachment1 = [MSErrorAttachmentLog attachmentWithText:@"Hello world!" filename:@"hello.txt"];
  MSErrorAttachmentLog *attachment2 = [MSErrorAttachmentLog attachmentWithBinary:[@"Fake image" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] filename:@"fake_image.jpeg" contentType:@"image/jpeg"];
  return @[ attachment1, attachment2 ];
}
```
```swift
func attachments(with crashes: MSCrashes, for errorReport: MSErrorReport) -> [MSErrorAttachmentLog] {
  let attachment1 = MSErrorAttachmentLog.attachment(withText: "Hello world!", filename: "hello.txt")
  let attachment2 = MSErrorAttachmentLog.attachment(withBinary: "Fake image".data(using: String.Encoding.utf8), filename: nil, contentType: "image/jpeg")
  return [attachment1!, attachment2!]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The size limit is currently 7 MB. Attempting to send a larger attachment will trigger an error.

## Disabling Mach exception handling

By default, App Center Crashes uses the Mach exception handler to catch fatal signals, e.g. stack overflows, via a Mach exception server.

The `disableMachExceptionHandler`-method provides an option to disable catching fatal signals via a Mach exception server. If you want to disable the Mach exception handler, you should call this method _BEFORE_ starting the SDK. Your typical setup code would look like this:

```objc
[MSCrashes disableMachExceptionHandler];
[MSAppCenter start:@"{Your App Secret}" withServices:@[[MSAnalytics class], [MSCrashes class]]];
```
```swift
MSCrashes.disableMachExceptionHandler()
MSAppCenter.start("{Your App Secret}", withServices: [MSAnalytics.self, MSCrashes.self])
```

## Enable or disable App Center Crashes at runtime

You can enable and disable App Center Crashes at runtime. If you disable it, the SDK will not do any crash reporting for the app.

```objc
[MSCrashes setEnabled:NO];
```
```swift
MSCrashes.setEnabled(false)
```

To enable App Center Crashes again, use the same API but pass `YES`/`true` as a parameter.

```objc
[MSCrashes setEnabled:YES];
```
```swift
MSCrashes.setEnabled(true)
```

## Check if App Center Crashes is enabled

You can also check if App Center Crashes is enabled or not:

```objc
BOOL enabled = [MSCrashes isEnabled];
```
```swift
var enabled = MSCrashes.isEnabled()
```
