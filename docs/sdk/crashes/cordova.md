App Center Crashes will automatically generate a crash log every time your app crashes. The log is first written to the device's storage and when the user starts the app again, the crash report will be sent to App Center. Collecting crashes works for both beta and live apps, i.e. those submitted to the App Store. Crash logs contain valuable information for you to help fix the crash.

Please follow the [Getting Started](~/sdk/getting-started/cordova.md) section if you haven't set up the SDK in your application yet.

## Generate a test crash

App Center Crashes provides you with an API to generate a test crash for easy testing of the SDK. This API can only be used in test/beta apps and won't do anything in production apps.

```js
Appcenter.Crashes.generateTestCrash();
```

> [!NOTE]
> Your Cordova app needs to be compiled in release mode for this crash to be sent to App Center.

## Get more information about a previous crash

App Center Crashes has two APIs that give you more information in case your app has crashed.

### Did the app crash in the previous session?

At any time after starting the SDK, you can check if the app crashed in the previous launch:

```js
var success = function(didCrash) {
    console.log("there was " + (didCrash ? "a" : "no") + " crash");
}

var error = function(error) {
    console.error(error);
}

Appcenter.Crashes.hasCrashedInLastSession(success, error);
```

This comes in handy in case you want to adjust the behavior or UI of your app after a crash has occured. Some developers may want to show something to apologize to their users, or to get in touch after a crash has occured.

### Details about the last crash

If your app crashed previously, you can get details about the last crash.

```js
var success = function(crashReport) {
    //do something with crash report
}

var error = function(error) {
    console.error(error);
}

Appcenter.Crashes.lastSessionCrashReport(success, error);
```

## Customize your usage of App Center Crashes

App Center Crashes provides abilities for developers to perform additional actions before and when sending crash logs to App Center.

### Processing crashes in JavaScript

You can configure SDK to send crash reports automatically or process crashes in JavaScript by changing preference `APPCENTER_CRASHES_ALWAYS_SEND` value in `config.xml`. To process crashes in JavaScript set it to `false`.

```xml
<preference name="APPCENTER_CRASHES_ALWAYS_SEND" value="false" />
```

Then you can use `AppCenter.Crashes.process(processFunction, errorCallback)` method to customize crashes procession.

### Should the crash be processed?

Pass `false` to the `sendCallback` if you'd like to decide if a particular crash needs to be processed or not. For example, there could be a system level crash that you'd want to ignore and that you don't want to send to App Center.

```js
var errorCallback = function(error) {
    console.error(error);
};

var processFunction = function(attachments, sendCallback) {
    sendCallback(false); //crash will not be sent
};

AppCenter.Crashes.process(processFunction, errorCallback);
```

Otherwise, pass `true` to the `sendCallback` function, and the crash will be sent.

```js
var errorCallback = function(error) {
    console.error(error);
};

var processFunction = function(attachments, sendCallback) {
    sendCallback(true); //crash will be sent
};

AppCenter.Crashes.process(processFunction, errorCallback);
```

> [!NOTE]
> To use this feature you need to set `APPCENTER_CRASHES_ALWAYS_SEND` preference value in `config.xml` to `false`.
>
> This feature is thus dependent on [Processing Crashes](#processing-crashes-in-javascript) in JavaScript.

### Add attachments to a crash report

You can add **one binary** and **one text** attachment to a crash report. The SDK will send it along with the crash so that you can see it in App Center portal. The following callback will be invoked if you want to add attachments to a crash report. Here is an example on how to attach a text and an image to a crash:

```js
var errorCallback = function(error) {
    console.error(error);
};

var processFunction = function(attachments, sendCallback) {
    attachments.addTextAttachment('Hello text attachment!', 'hello.txt');
    var imageAsBase64string = '...';
    attachments.addBinaryAttachment(imageAsBase64string, 'logo.png', 'image/png');
    sendCallback(true); //crash will be sent
};

AppCenter.Crashes.process(processFunction, errorCallback);
```

> [!NOTE]
> To use that feature you need to set `APPCENTER_CRASHES_ALWAYS_SEND` preference value in `config.xml` to `false`.
>
> This feature is thus dependent on [Processing Crashes](#processing-crashes-in-javascript) in JavaScript.

> [!NOTE]
> The size limit is currently 1.4 MB on Android and 7 MB on iOS. Attempting to send a larger attachment will trigger an error.

## Enable or disable App Center Crashes at runtime

You can enable and disable App Center Crashes at runtime. If you disable it, the SDK will not do any crash reporting for the app.

```js
var success = function() {
    console.log("crashes disabled");
}

var error = function(error) {
    console.error(error);
}

AppCenter.Crashes.setEnabled(false, success, error);
```

To enable App Center Crashes again, use the same API but pass `true` as a parameter.

```js
var success = function() {
    console.log("crashes enabled");
}

var error = function(error) {
    console.error(error);
}

AppCenter.Crashes.setEnabled(true, success, error);
```

## Check if App Center Crashes is enabled

You can also check whether App Center Crashes is enabled:

```js
var success = function(result) {
    console.log("crashes " + (result) ? "enabled" : "disabled");
}

var error = function(error) {
    console.error(error);
}
AppCenter.Crashes.isEnabled(success, error);
```
