App Center Analytics helps you understand user behavior and customer engagement to improve your app. The SDK automatically captures session count and device properties like model, OS version, etc. You can define your own custom events to measure things that matter to you. All the information captured is available in the App Center portal for you to analyze the data.

Please follow the [Get started](~/sdk/getting-started/react-native.md) section if you haven't set up the SDK in your application yet.

## Session and device information

Once you add App Center Analytics to your app and the SDK is started, it will automatically track sessions and device properties like OS Version, model, etc. You donâ€™t need to write any additional code.

## Custom events

You can track your own custom events with **up to five properties** to know what's happening in your app, understand user actions, and see the aggregates in the App Center portal.

Once you have started the SDK, use the `trackEvent` method to track your events with properties. You can send **up to 200 distinct event names**. Also, there is a maximum limit of 256 characters per event name and 64 characters per event property name and event property value.

```javascript
// import App Center Analytics at the top of the file.
import Analytics from 'appcenter-analytics';

Analytics.trackEvent('Video clicked', { Category: 'Music', FileName: 'favorite.avi' });
```

This function returns a promise, in which the success case returns an empty string, and the error case returns the error.

Properties for events are entirely optional. If you just want to track an event, use this sample instead:

```javascript
Analytics.trackEvent('Video clicked');
```

## Enable or disable App Center Analytics at runtime

You can enable and disable App Center Analytics at runtime. If you disable it, the SDK will not collect any more analytics information for the app.

```javascript
await Analytics.setEnabled(false);
```

This function returns a promise, in which the success case returns an empty string, and the error case returns the error.

To enable App Center Analytics again, use the same API but pass `true` as a parameter.

```javascript
await Analytics.setEnabled(true);
```

## Check if App Center Analytics is enabled

You can also check if App Center Analytics is enabled or not.

```javascript
const enabled = await Analytics.isEnabled();
```

This function returns a promise, in which the success case returns a `boolean`, and the error case returns the error.

## Wait for JS to enable App Center Analytics

In some cases, an application may want to ask users whether they want to share analytics information. In that case, during installation, you should select `Enable in JavaScript` during `react-native link`.

```
For the [platform] app, should user tracking be enabled automatically ? (Use arrow keys)
          Enable Automatically
        > Enable in JavaScript
```

This means that for any information to be sent to App Center (even basic session information), the developer must first enable App Center Analytics inside the app by adding the following line to their code.

```javascript
await Analytics.setEnabled(true);
```
