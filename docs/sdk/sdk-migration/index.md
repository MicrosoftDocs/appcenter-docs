# Migration document for App Center SDK

App Center is your continuous integration, delivery and learning solution for iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS apps.

If you have set up your application with preview version of our old SDKs, now is the time to migrate them to App Center SDK. Here are the guidelines to update your application to the App Center SDKs.

## Guidelines

1. Preview SDK is still going to work but we highly recommend you to transition to the latest stable SDK.
2. You will need to rename and update few SDK APIs. Detailed documentation is here:
    * [Android](android.md)
    * [iOS](ios.md)
    * [React Native](react-native.md)
    * [UWP](uwp.md)
    * [Xamarin](xamarin.md)

## Source code

The App Center SDKs are open-source and available publicly on GitHub:

* [App Center SDK for Android](https://github.com/Microsoft/AppCenter-SDK-Android)
* [App Center SDK for iOS and macOS](https://github.com/Microsoft/AppCenter-SDK-Apple)
