## 'React/RCTDefines.h' file not found

This error appears when RN core libraries are not referenced correctly, which can be caused by a variety of integrating/linking issues.
It often happens when you have your dependencies linked using relative path in a podfile, rather than statically in a project.
Our linking script supports only the standard way of linking pods, so in order to resolve this, do the following:

1. Replace the dependencies in your `Podfile` with relative linking paths:

    Before:

    ```ruby
    pod 'AppCenter/Analytics', '~> 1.14.0'
    pod 'AppCenter/Crashes', '~> 1.14.0'
    pod 'AppCenter/Push', '~> 1.14.0'
    pod 'AppCenterReactNativeShared', '~> 1.13.0'
    ```

    After:

    ```ruby
    pod 'appcenter', path: '../node_modules/appcenter/ios'
    pod 'appcenter-analytics', path: '../node_modules/appcenter-analytics/ios'
    pod 'appcenter-crashes', path: '../node_modules/appcenter-crashes/ios'
    pod 'appcenter-push', path: '../node_modules/appcenter-push/ios'
    ```

1. Run `pod install` from `iOS` folder.

1. Inside **AppDelegate.m**, replace imports:

    Before:

    ```objective-c
    #import <AppCenterReactNative/AppCenterReactNative.h>
    #import <AppCenterReactNativeAnalytics/AppCenterReactNativeAnalytics.h>
    #import <AppCenterReactNativeCrashes/AppCenterReactNativeCrashes.h>
    #import <AppCenterReactNativePush/AppCenterReactNativePush.h>
    ```

    After:

    ```objective-c
    #import "AppCenterReactNative.h"
    #import "AppCenterReactNativeAnalytics.h"
    #import "AppCenterReactNativeCrashes.h"
    #import "AppCenterReactNativePush.h"
    ```

1. Remove AppCenter dependencies from the project (right-click the dependency > Remove dependency).
    * Select **<YOUR_APP>** -> **Libraries** and remove next files:
        * `AppCenterReactNative.xcodeproj`
        * `AppCenterReactNativeAnalytics.xcodeproj`
        * `AppCenterReactNativeCrashes.xcodeproj`
        * `AppCenterReactNativePush.xcodeproj`
    * Open your project settings and under **General** tab in the **Linked Frameworks and Libraries** section remove new items referencing target libraries removed on the previous step:
        * `libAppCenterReactNative.a`
        * `libAppCenterReactNativeAnalytics.a`
        * `libAppCenterReactNativeCrashes.a`
        * `libAppCenterReactNativePush.a`
    * Modify **Header Search Paths** to remove headers from the AppCenter React Native plugins projects. Open your project settings and under **Build Settings** tab in the **Header Search Paths** section remove the following locations for header files:
        * `$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/appcenter/ios/AppCenterReactNative`
        * `$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/appcenter-analytics/ios/AppCenterReactNativeAnalytics`
        * `$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/appcenter-crashes/ios/AppCenterReactNativeCrashes`
        * `$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/appcenter-push/ios/AppCenterReactNativePush`

## React Native link command unrecognized

If you have `yarn` installed on your machine, `react-native init {myapp}` will initialize your app and install dependencies using `yarn` rather than `npm`. If you see the following error message when running `react-native link`, chances are App Center dependencies are installed from `npm install {package}` instead of `yarn add {package}` so that `npm` and `yarn` are mixed during installation.

```Text
Command `link` unrecognized. Make sure that you have run `npm install` and that you are inside a react-native project.
```

In this case, run `npm install` and try `react-native link` again.

## Build error such as 'AppCenterCrashes/MSErrorReport.h' file not found

One possible cause is when running `react-native link` without **CocoaPods** installed.

To confirm the cause, execute `react-native link`, and in the logs, check for the following line:

```Text
Could not configure AppCenter for iOS. Error Reason - spawn pod ENOENT
```

This line is located in the following section of the logs:

```Text
Added code to initialize iOS AppCenter SDK in ios/TestApp/AppDelegate.m
Installing Cocoapods dependencies...
Could not configure AppCenter for iOS. Error Reason - spawn pod ENOENT
rnpm-install info Platform 'ios' module appcenter-analytics is already linked
rnpm-install info Platform 'android' module appcenter-analytics is already linked
```

If you see that error, make sure the `pod` command from **CocoaPods** is available in your system's **PATH** environment variable.

After you fix your **CocoaPods** installation, run `pod install` in the **ios** folder to fix your project.

## CocoaPods unable to find a specification for AppCenterReactNativeShared during react-native link

If you see the following CocoaPods error message during `react-native link`, chances are your local clone (`~/.cocoapods/repos` on your machine) of the [CocoaPods spec repo](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs) is not up-to-date.

```Text
Analyzing dependencies [!] Unable to find a specification for AppCenterReactNativeShared (~> {version})
```

You should run `pod repo update` to update the spec repo, and try `react-native link` again. For more information of CocoaPods commands, please see [CocoaPods command line reference](https://guides.cocoapods.org/terminal/commands.html#pod_repo_update).

## How to upgrade app using App Center SDK from React Native 0.59 to 0.60

For upgrading React Native to the version 0.60.0 use the following command:

```shell
react-native upgrade 0.60.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> If during an upgrade you get this error `Command failed: git status -s fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git`, perform the next steps:
>   ```shell
>   git init
>   git add .
>   git commit -m "Upgrade react-native"
>   ```
> After you finish upgrading you may remove the `.git` directory.

#### Update React Native iOS

1. Open **Podfile** and replace App Center dependencies on the following line:

    ```ruby
    use_native_modules!
    ```

2. Run the following command:

    ```shell
    pod repo update
    ```

## How to update React Native SDK to the latest version

If you have already integrated our SDK into your application and want to upgrade to a newer version of the SDK, please follow the following steps to upgrade:

1. `npm uninstall --save appcenter appcenter-analytics appcenter-crashes appcenter-push` to uninstall old App Center packages.

2. `npm install --save-exact appcenter appcenter-analytics appcenter-crashes appcenter-push` to install latest App Center packages.

3. `pod repo update` to make sure your CocoaPods spec repo is up-to-date.

4. `react-native link`.

> [!TIP]
> If you see error message similar to the following CocoaPods error message during `react-native link`, just delete the auto-generated **Podfile.lock** in your **ios** folder and run `react-native link` again.

> ```Text
> [!] Unable to satisfy the following requirements:
>
> - `AppCenter/Core (= 1.0.0)` required by `Podfile.lock`
> - `AppCenter/Core (= 1.0.0)` required by `AppCenter/Push (1.0.0)`
> - `AppCenter/Core (= 1.0.0)` required by `AppCenter/Crashes (1.0.0)`
> - `AppCenter/Core (= 1.0.0)` required by `AppCenter/Analytics (1.0.0)`
> - `AppCenter/Core (= 1.0.1)` required by `AppCenterReactNativeShared (1.0.1)`
> ```
