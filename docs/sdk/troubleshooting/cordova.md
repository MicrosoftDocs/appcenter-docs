## Failed to install plugin - pod command failed with exit code 1

After updating to the latest plugin version, chances are you will see the following error message during `cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-appcenter-<module>`:

```Text
Installing "cordova-plugin-appcenter-shared" for ios
Failed to install 'cordova-plugin-appcenter-shared': Error: pod: Command failed with exit code 1
```

In `0.3.0` we dropped iOS 8 support. The issue with this is that the `4.5.5` version of `cordova-ios` by default targeted ios `9.0`, but used ios `8.0` in the podfile. This has been fixed with `cordova-ios 5.0.0`.

There are two ways to resolve this:

1. `cordova platform add ios@5.0.0`

1. If for some reason you want to stay on older cordova version, go to `platforms` > `ios`, open `Podfile` and change `platform :ios, '8.0'` to `platform :ios, '9.0'`. Then run `pod install`.

## Failed to install 'cordova-plugin-appcenter-shared': undefined

One possible cause of this error is when running `cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-appcenter-<module>` without **CocoaPods** installed.

In this case, the error usually includes this line:

```Text
Error: CocoaPods was not found. Please install version 1.0.1 or greater from https://cocoapods.org/
```

If you see this line, simply run:

```shell
sudo gem install cocoapods
pod setup
```

## CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "AppCenter"

If you see the following error message during `cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-appcenter-<module>`, chances are your local clone (`~/.cocoapods/repos` on your system) of the [CocoaPods spec repo](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs) is not up-to-date.

```Text
CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "AppCenter":
 In Podfile:
   AppCenter (~> 1.12.0)
```

You should run `pod repo update` to update the spec repo, and try adding the plugin again. For more information on CocoaPods commands, please see the [CocoaPods command line reference](https://guides.cocoapods.org/terminal/commands.html#pod_repo_update).

## Module 'AppCenter' not found iOS build error

If you see the following error message during `cordova build ios`, it means that something went wrong with **CocoaPods** installation:

```Text
.../cordova-plugin-appcenter-shared/AppCenterShared.h:3:9: fatal error: module 'AppCenter' not found
@import AppCenter;
~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.
```

One possible cause is that your local clone (`~/.cocoapods/repos` on your machine) of the [CocoaPods spec repo](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs) is not up-to-date.

Run `pod repo update` to update the spec repo, and try adding plugin again. For more information on CocoaPods commands, please see the [CocoaPods command line reference](https://guides.cocoapods.org/terminal/commands.html#pod_repo_update).

## Archive not found at path iOS build error

If you see the following error message during `cordova build ios`, you must switch to the legacy build system.

```Text
error: archive not found at path '.../platforms/ios/MyApp.xcarchive'
** EXPORT FAILED **
```

To resolve this issue, specify `--buildFlag="-UseModernBuildSystem=0"` when running build. The solution is also described in [this StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52400072/7453375).

## Could not find method google() for arguments [] on repository container Android build error

If you see the following error message during `cordova build android`, chances are your `cordova-android` version is too low.

```Text
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* Where:
Script '.../cordova/platforms/android/cordova-plugin-appcenter-push/testpush-AppCenterPush.gradle' line: 3

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred evaluating script.
> Could not find method google() for arguments [] on repository container.
```

You should update `cordova-android` to at least `6.4.0`. You can run `cordova platform update android` to update the platform to the latest version or `cordova platform add android@6.4.0` to use the exact version.

## Analytics not showing up in the portal

Make sure you've added this line to your configuration file:

`<preference name="APPCENTER_ANALYTICS_ENABLE_IN_JS" value="true" />`

By default this value is `false`.
