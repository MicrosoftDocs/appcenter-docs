# SDK Limitations & Known Issues

## Limitations

### React Native

1. The React Native SDK currently does not support In-App-Updates. The reason for this is that one of React Nativeâ€™s main features is that it allows to deploy apps using [CodePush](https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/) without the need to distribute a new build.

### Xamarin

1. Crashes caused by `StackOverflowException` are not reported. This is a limitation of the Xamarin runtime.
2. You can't use most AppCenter SDK APIs in Xamarin Forms application constructor if you want to use the previewer because the Xamarin previewer does not support native code.
3. An application using the AppCenter SDK cannot be deployed to the Xamarin Live Player as the SDK contains native code.

### Xamarin.Android and React Native for Android

1. The size limit for each crash attachment on these platforms is currently 1.4 MB.
