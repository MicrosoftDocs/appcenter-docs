# Push FAQ

**When sending a Push to device IDs, how many devices can I send to each request?**

You can send up to 20 devices in single send request.

**Is it possible to call AppCenter.Start() a second time to add Push, rather then when other services like Crashes, and Analytics are initilized?**

Yes, you can call `AppCenter.Start("{APP-SECRET}", services)` as usual (without specifying the Push  service). Then, once the user has opted in to receive push notifications, you can call `AppCenter.Start(typeof(Push))` to start just the Push service.
Note that the second call to `Start()` does not include the app secret.

**iOS: I'm seeing a Expired Channel error after I attempted to send a Push, how can I resolve it?** 

The Expired Channel error means that the token issued by Apple for the device expired and can no longer be used to send notifications to that device. The token must be re-issued on the device and re-registered with App Center Push. The App Center SDK should handle this for you when the app starts (see [add the start method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/sdk/push/ios#22-add-the-startwithservices-method) in the App Center SDK documentation).

One of the reasons could be that you are using a Sandbox token to send a Push Notification in a Production App. 

**Can I delay showing the Push Notifications permission pop-up until the user click a button or a certain screen?**

You can do this by delaying the `AppCenter.Start(typeof(Push))` method call until you want the permission pop-up to show up. Here's how: 

`// call start with app secret WITHOUT Push`

`AppCenter.Start(appCenterAPIKey, typeof(Crashes), typeof(Analytics));`

`// then on button click do:`

`AppCenter.Start(typeof(Push));`
