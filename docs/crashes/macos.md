# macOS Crashes

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> * [Android](android.md)
> * [iOS](ios.md)
> * [React Native](react-native.md)
> * [macOS](macos.md)

## Getting Started

1. Integrate the SDK as described in the [Getting Started with macOS](~/sdk/getting-started/macos.md) documentation.
2. Upload the symbols that are created with each build using the *Incoming* page under the app.
3. Add a test crash to the app's code by calling the `generateTestCrash` method of the crash reporting module as an action to a button.
4. Run the app without the debugger connected, crash it and restart it.
5. After a few minutes the crash report should be visible in the UI.

## Uploading symbols

1. Create a ZIP file for the dSYM package on your Mac.
2. Open the *Incoming* page under *Crash Reporting* on App Center of the app.
3. Upload the zip file.
4. After the zip file is indexed by App Center new incoming crashes will be symbolicated.

## Troubleshooting

1. *Why are crash reports not visible after a few minutes?*

    Right now crash reports are only visible if they can be symbolicated. For that to happen the proper symbols (dSYM) need to be uploaded. There will be a UI available later that shows which symbols are missing and how to find them.

2. *What could be another reason for the crash report to not appear?*

    Make sure the app doesn't crash on startup, as the SDK wouldn't have time to send the crash report. This is a limitation for any 3rd party crash reporting service.

3. *The symbols are uploaded but the previous crash reports are not appearing.*

    As of now only new incoming crashes will be symbolicated. Processing pending crashes is on our roadmap.
