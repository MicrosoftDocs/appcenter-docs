# Distributing Releases

App Center has the next generation of HockeyApp’s distribution features. During the HockeyApp transition period, use our [side-by-side experience]( ~/transition/side-by-side.md) to get familiar with the new interface and begin exploring powerful new distribution features exclusive to App Center. You can distribute new releases in both App Center and HockeyApp for your HockeyApp apps. 

## Distributing to a HockeyApp Distribution Group in App Center 

You can distribute new releases for your HockeyApp apps in App Center. When you distribute a new release in App Center to one of your HockeyApp side-by-side distribution groups, your HockeyApp testers will continue to receive the notification from HockeyApp. Additionally, the new release will appear in both App Center and HockeyApp. 

## Distributing to an App Center Distribution Group

In addition to using your HockeyApp distribution groups, you can also create new distribution groups for your HockeyApp apps in App Center. It is important to note that releases distributed to a group created in App Center will not be reflected in HockeyApp. Also, the testers you invite to your new App Center distribution groups will receive app invitations and new release notifications from App Center, not HockeyApp.
