# HockeyApp Feedback

HockeyApp Feedback data wasn't migrated to App Center. In the following sections weâ€™re laying out ways how you can replicate similar functionality in your app with other tools than HockeyApp.

## Microsoft Flow & Azure Boards

With Flow + Azure Boards, users can fill out an online form to submit their feedback.  Flow then takes the form submission and auto creates a work item in Azure Boards.  Flow will also autopost the feedback into [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software).

**To start:**

1. Create a feedback submission form with [Microsoft Forms](https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPage.aspx).  This should include a free text form for the user to input their feedback.

2. Log into [Microsoft Flow](https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/), and create the [Automatically file bugs and notify team](https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/galleries/public/templates/1a5cd7ae0a3746b39696556ae702c53e/automatically-file-bugs-and-notify-team/) workflow.
3. In Microsoft Flow, connect to Azure DevOps, Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Forms.
4. Select your feedback submission form in the Microsoft Flow setup wizard.
5. Once your Flow is set up, return to your feedback form in Microsoft Forms.  From the sharing settings on your form, select **Anyone with the link can respond**.

6. Add a link in your app that allows users to access the url of your feedback form.
