# Build

Mobile Center helps you build the mobile apps you and your team is working on, using a secure infrastructure. You can forget about configuring build servers locally, complicated configurations and code that is working on a co-worker's machine, but not working on yours.

To get started, a member of the app in Mobile Center needs to connect to their source control and select the repository where the app is located and then start building your app with only a few clicks.

Currently, you can only build apps hosted in a GitHub repository.

While in public preview, we are constantly adding features and further platform support. If you are developing a mobile app in a platform that is not supported, chances are our team is working on it. Don't hesitate to contact us and let us know more about your needs.
