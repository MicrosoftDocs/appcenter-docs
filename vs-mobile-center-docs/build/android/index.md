# Android Build

You can build Android apps written in the following languages/frameworks:

* [Java](first-build/java.md)
* [Xamarin](first-build/xamarin.md)
* [React Native](first-build/react-native.md)

While in limited preview, some of the features might not be available to all users. If you have interest in a specific feature, but you cannot find it in the UI, contact us to get access to the latest bits.
