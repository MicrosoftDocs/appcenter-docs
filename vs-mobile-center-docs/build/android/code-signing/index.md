# Android Code signing

To run an app on real devices during the development process or to distribute it via a beta program or in the Play Store it is required that the app is signed. Without code signing, the app can be only ran on an emulator.

To code sign a build, you can learn more [here](~/build/android/code-signing/setup.md).
