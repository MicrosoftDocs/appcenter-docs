# Android Code signing

To run an app on real devices during the development process or to distribute it via a beta program or in the Play Store it is required that the app is signed. Without code signing, the app can be only ran on a simulator or on a jailbroken device.

To code sign a build, upload a Keystore (.jks) to the same repository as the app.
