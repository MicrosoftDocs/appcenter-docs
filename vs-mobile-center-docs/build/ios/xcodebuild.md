# The internals of an Xcode build 
iOS builds are generated by using the xcodebuild tool. Xcodebuild is a command-line tool that allows you to perform: build, query, analyze, test, and archive operations on your Xcode projects and workspaces from the command line. Xcodebuild supports various build actions such as build, analyze, and archive that can be performed on your target or scheme.
We use xcodebuild to perform archive and export:
* If your build is unsigned the `clean archive` command is performed and generates an .xcarchive file.
* If your build is signed, after archiving the build the command `exportArchive` is performed and generates an .ipa file.


# What has changed?

* Build configuration has changed - with the move to xcodebuild, we changed the build action to `clean archive`, which by default is set to the release          configuration. This may be a different configuration from the `build` action that was used with xcrun.
* xcarchive file - an unsigned build will no longer produce the .ipa file; this is due to the fact that xcodebuild doesn't allow exporting builds that are not signed. If you wish to generate an .ipa file with the artifacts of an unsigned build, you can use the .xcarchive file to do so.
