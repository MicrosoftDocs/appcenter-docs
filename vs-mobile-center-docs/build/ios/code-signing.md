# Code signing for iOS

To run an app on a real device during the development process through a beta program or in the App Store, it must be code signed. You can code sign a build by uploading your provisioning profile (.mobileprovision) and certificate (.p12) when [configuring the build](first-build.md).

## Automatic vs. manual code signing
When **Automatically manage signing** is enabled in the target of your project, you have to make sure to upload the provisioining profile generated by Xcode. For manual signing you have to use the one from the Apple Developer Portal. Learn more about where to [find the provisioning profiles and certificates](~/build/ios/uploading-signing-files.md) that are required for signing.

>[!NOTE]
>To build your project with App Center, make sure that the files you are uploading match the code signing in the targets of your project. App Center will build the "build configuration" selected in the scheme.

### Automatic signing and CI
With automatic signing, there are two steps to exporting an app: Archive and Export. Archive creates an archive file signed with **development code signing**. Export then re-signs the archive with a **certificate matching the export method** (App Store, Ad Hoc or Enterprise). If the used export method is not Development then the signing process requires two different certificates and provisioning profiles: one for the Archive action and one for the Export action.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>At the moment, App Center only supports to sign your app with a Developer certificate and provisioning profile when **Automatically manage signing** is enabled. Support to sign with a Distribution certificate and provisioning profile will be added at a later time.

## Certificates (.p12)
- **iOS Development:** Used to enable certain app services during development and testing.
- **iOS Distribution:** For submission to the App Store, Ad Hoc or Enterprise distribution.

## Provisioning Profiles (.mobileprovision)
- **iOS App Development:** Install development apps on developer test devices.
- **Ad Hoc:** Install an app on a limited number of registered devices.
- **App Store:** Required for submitting your app to the App Store.
- **In House:** for In House app distribution (the profile is only available via the Apple Enterprise program).
