# Configure an iOS build

The general idea for setting up a build is similar across all platforms. Firstly you need to give App Center access to your source control, then select a repository and a branch to build, and then setup the build configuration depending on the platform your app is being developed on.

The specific steps can be found on the platform-specific pages:
* [Objective C / Swift](Xcode.md)
* [Xamarin](xamarin/index.md)
* [React Native](react-native.md)

We are constantly adding features and more capabilities. If you need further support in building your app, [contact us](https://intercom.help/appcenter/) and let us know more about your needs.
