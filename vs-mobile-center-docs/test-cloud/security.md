# Test Cloud Security

Devices in Test Cloud are part of a shared public cloud, meaning that many users will install their app and run their tests on the same physical devices. While Test Cloud prohibits uploading personally identifiable information (PII), measures are taken to ensure security across test runs by different users.

- Any apps installed during a test run are uninstalled
- All local storage is cleared from the device
- Devices are restored to their default settings
