# Preparing Xamarin.UITest Tests for Upload

For detailed instructions on preparing Xamarin.UITest tests for upload,
see the [Xamarin documentation](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/uitest/).

Note you should not need to make any changes to your existing Xamarin.UITest tests to run them in Mobile Center.
You will only need the [Mobile Center CLI](~/cli/index.md) and then command generated by
following the on-screen instructions in the **new test run** dialog.
