# Install a Build

Installation of an application being distributed by Mobile Center begins with an email. If you have access to the application you will receive a notification email for each new version available. Simply click on the install link in the email to begin the process. You will need to enter your credentials to login. If this is your first time accessing Mobile Center, you can instead [create a new account][signup]. Once logged in you can review the application information and release notes, and click the install button to trigger installation onto your device.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On iOS you must open the email install link in Safari, only Safari supports the installation APIs.
