# Creating and managing apps

## Creating an app

To create an app, log in and click the **Add new** dropdown and choose **Add new app**.

## Accessing apps

All apps you belong to can be found in **My Apps**. When looking for apps owned by organizations you belong to, click on the organization in the left navigation.

## App roles

On each app there are three roles:

* **Managers** can manage app settings, collaborators, and integrations.

* **Developers** can manage app services (e.g. create builds, run tests).

* **Viewers** can view and download all data but cannot make changes.

To change the permission of a collaborator, select an app, click **Manage app** and use the dropdown to re-assign the role. Only 'Managers' can change collaborator permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> Every app that you create, whether it be owned by you or an organization, you automatically become a 'Manager'.

## Adding collaborators to apps

To share your app with others, select an app and then click **Manage app** to add collaborators by typing in the user's email address.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are not a 'Manager' role on an app, you cannot add collaborators to that app.
