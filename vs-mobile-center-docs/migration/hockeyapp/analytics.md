# HockeyApp Analytics in Mobile Center

Mobile Center provides an Analytics tool that will allow you to get insights about your users and actions they are taking in your app. By taking advantage of our side by side experience, you will be able to see all your Analytics data not only in HockeyApp, but also in Mobile Center.

## What's new about Analytics in Mobile Center

Mobile Center Analytics provides an improved experience with respect to HockeyApp. Apart from the Analytics information that you are already getting in HockeyApp, you will also get information about:
- Session Duration
- Devices
- Languages
- Longer retention period (up to 90 days)
- Incoming logs in real time (log flow)

Once you are ready to make a full move to Mobile Center, you will also get information about the countries your users are in.

Mobile Center also provides more insights about your custom events with metrics such as count per user and count per session, option to delete individual events and no limitations in the character types for your event names.

## HockeyApp Bridge App

Mobile Center Analytics does not currently offer an option to Export or forward your data to another tool. However, we are currently working on an option to export your data, which will offer a similar experience to the HockeyApp Bridge app to Application Insights.
